		Many land allocation issues, such as land-use planning, require input from extensive spatial databases and involve complex decision-making. Spatial decision support systems (SDSS) are designed to make these issues more transparent and to support the design and evaluation of land allocation alternatives. In this paper we analyze techniques for visualizing uncertainty of an urban growth model called SLEUTH, which is designed to aid decision-makers in the field of urban planning and fits into the computational framework of an SDSS. Two simple visualization techniques for portraying uncertainty-static comparison and toggling-are applied to SLEUTH results and rendered with different background information and color schemes. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the two visualization techniques, a web-based survey was developed showing the visualizations along with questions about the usefulness of the two techniques. The web survey proved to be quickly accessible and easy to understand by the participants. Participants in the survey were mainly recruited among planners and decision-makers. They acknowledged the usefulness of portraying uncertainty for decision-making purposes. They slightly favored the static comparison technique over toggling. Both visualization techniques were applied to an urban growth case study for the greater Santa Barbara area in California, USA.

		The presence of uncertainty in geographical data has the potential to expose users to undesirable consequences in their decision making. Accordingly, our efforts to understand uncertainty seek to (a) avoid the use of data that are not suitable for their intended purpose (that is, data whose consequences are unacceptable), (b) to reduce any undesirable consequences to an acceptable level, and (c) to devise ways of living with undesirable data when the adverse consequences caused by poor data do not alter our ultimate decision choice. To assist this task, we propose an approach where the adverse consequences of uncertainty caused by the use of unsuitable geographical data are expressed in terms of risk. In this paper we first show that risk management offers geographical data users a range of options for responding to the adverse consequences of data uncertainty, and secondly we present and discuss the various risk response options.

		Few human factors studies have addressed the issue of displaying the uncertainty of information provided to users; an issue of growing importance given the current proliferation of advanced situation awareness and navigation displays used in the aviation, automotive and maritime environments. This paper first discusses the growing need to develop guidelines concerning when and how to display uncertainty, and then describes the results of two initial studies aimed at both demonstrating the general utility of displaying uncertainty, and determining the optimal ways to visually represent various levels of uncertainty. We conclude that the impact and effectiveness of future multi-sensor situation awareness displays will be dependent on the skillful presentation of data uncertainty.

		Predictive modeling's effectiveness is hindered by inherent uncertainties in the input parameters. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis quantify these uncertainties and identify the relationships between input and output variations, leading to the construction of a more accurate model. This survey introduces the application, implementation, and underlying principles of sensitivity and uncertainty quantification.

		In a variety of settings, it is desirable to display a collection of likelihoods over a common interval. One approach is simply to superimpose the likelihood curves. However, where there are more than a handful of curves, such displays are extremely difficult to decipher. An alternative is simply to display a point estimate with a confidence interval, corresponding to each likelihood. However, these may be inadequate when the likelihood is not approximately normal, as can occur with small sample sizes or nonlinear models. A second dimension is needed to gauge the relative plausibility of different parameter values. We introduce the raindrop plot, a shaded figure over the range of parameter values having log-likelihood greater than some cutoff, with height varying proportional to the difference between the loglikelihood and the cutoff. In the case of a normal likelihood,this produces a reflected parabola so that deviations from normality can be easily detected. An analogue of the raindrop plot can also be used to display estimated random effect distributions, posterior distributions, and predictive distributions.

		This research compared visual (color), auditory (tone pitch), and tactile (vibration amplitude) displays of uncertainty in a threat avoidance task. Thirty participants used these displays to navigate through a simulated minefield, selecting paths that would minimize their chance of hitting a mine, while moving through the field as quickly and directly as possible. Results showed the participants in the visual condition to be the most conservative (safer but longer), while those in the auditory condition took the shortest (riskier) path. Interestingly, in terms of trial time, while all participants tended to improve their performance with respect to speed, participants in the tactile condition started out more slowly, but were similar in speed to the fastest, visual condition, by the end of the trials.

	<div class="tec-abstract">
		This report is a summary of the Specialist meeting for NCGIA Research Initiative 7 entitled \"Visualization of Spatial Data Quality\". It presents initial discussions on the role and utility of visualization for understanding and analyzing information about the quality of GIS data. The impetus for the initiative is based on rapid changes in spatial information system technology and a desire to see the technology used more effectively. Technology currently allows us to process and display large volumes of information very quickly. Effective use of this information for analysis and decision making presupposes that the information is correct or reasonably reliable. Information on the quality of data is essential for effective use of GIS data: it affects the fitness of use of data for a particular application, the credibility of data representation and interpretation, and the evaluation of decision alternatives. The credibility of spatial decision support using GIS may indeed depend on the incorporation of quality information within the database and the display.

		Visualization encompasses the display of quantities or qualities of visible or invisible phenomena through the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, color, and animation. The objectives of visualization are to provoke insights and expand comprehension of information by revealing complex relationships among data. Geographical information is visualized in the form of maps. Recent concern over the accuracy and reliability of spatial information in geographic information systems has raised an interest in applying visualization tools to comprehend and communicate the reliability of GIS information and products. This paper develops design requirements for visualization of spatial data quality based on characterizations of quality, a range of quality assessment tasks, and different contexts under which data quality might be investigated.

	<div class="tec-abstract">
		A dynamic graphical method is one in which a data analyst interacts in real time with a data display on a computer graphics terminal. Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations- highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label-are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes-transient, lasting, and undo-and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.

		Little is known about researchers' understanding of confidence intervals (CIs) and standard error (SE) bars. Authors of journal articles in psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medicine were invited to visit a Web site where they adjusted a figure until they judged 2 means, with error bars, to be just statistically significantly different (p less than 0.05). Results from 473 respondents suggest that many leading researchers have severe misconceptions about how error bars relate to statistical significance, do not adequately distinguish CIs and SE bars, and do not appreciate the importance of whether the 2 means are independent or come from a repeated measures design. Better guidelines for researchers and less ambiguous graphical conventions are needed before the advantages of CIs for research communication can be realized.

		Quantitative graphics have been central to the development of science, and statistical graphics date from the earliest attempts to analyze data. Many familiar forms, including bivariate plots, statistical maps, bar charts, and coordinate paper, were used in the 18th century. Statistical graphics developed through attention to four problems: spatial organization (17th and 18th centuries), discrete comparison (18th and early 19th centuries), continuous distribution (19th century), and multivariate distribution and correlation (late 19th and early 20th centuries). Today, statistical graphics appear to be reemerging as an important analytic tool, with recent innovations exploiting computer graphics and related technologies.

		Variations of the boxplot are suggested, in which the sides of the box are used to convey information about the density of the values in a batch. The ease of computation by hand of the original boxplot had to be sacrificed, as the variations are computer-intensive. Still, the plots were implemented on a desktop personal computer (Apple Macintosh), in a way designed to keep their ease of computation by computer. The result is a dynamic display of densities and summaries.

		Systems projecting a continuous n-dimensional parameter space to a continuous m-dimensional target space play an important role in science and engineering. If evaluating the system is expensive, however, an analysis is often limited to a small number of sample points. The main contribution of this paper is an interactive approach to enable a continuous analysis of a sampled parameter space with respect to multiple target values. We employ methods from statistical learning to predict results in real-time at any user-defined point and its neighborhood. In particular, we describe techniques to guide the user to potentially interesting parameter regions, and we visualize the inherent uncertainty of predictions in 2D scatterplots and parallel coordinates. An evaluation describes a realworld scenario in the application context of car engine design and reports feedback of domain experts. The results indicate that our approach is suitable to accelerate a local sensitivity analysis of multiple target dimensions, and to determine a sufficient local sampling density for interesting parameter regions.

		We conducted four studies regarding the representation of probabilistic information. Experiments 1 through 3 compared performance on a simulated stock purchase task, in which information regarding stock profitability was probabilistic. Two variables were manipulated: display format for probabilistic information (blurred and colored icons, linguistic phrases, numeric expressions, and combinations) and specificity level (in which the number and size of discrete steps into which the probabilistic information was mapped differed). Results indicated few performance differences attributable to display format; however, performance did improve with greater specificity. Experiment 4, in which participants generated membership functions corresponding to three display formats, found a high degree of similarity in functions across formats and participants and a strong relationship between the shape of the membership function and the intended meaning of the representation. These results indicate that participants can successfully interpret nonnumeric representations of uncertainty and can use such representations in a manner similar to the way numeric expressions are used in a decision-making task. Actual or potential applications of this research include the use of graphical representations of uncertainty in systems such as command and control and situation displays.

		Supporting complex decision making requires conveying relevant information characteristics or qualifiers. The authors tested transparency and numeric annotation for displaying uncertainty about object identity. Participants performed a "missile defense" game in which they decided whether to destroy moving objects (which were either threatening missiles or nonthreatening birds and planes) before they reached a city. Participants were provided with uncertain information about the objects' classifica-tions. Uncertainty was represented through the transparency of icons representing the objects and/or with numeric annotations. Three display methods were created. Icons represented the most likely object classification (with solid icons), the most likely object classification (with icons whose transparency represented the level of uncertainty), or the probability that the icon was a missile (with transparency). In a fourth condition, participants could choose among the representations. Icons either were or were not annotated with numeric probability labels. Task performance was highest when participants could toggle the displays, with little effect of numeric annotation. In conditions in which probabilities were available graphically or numerically, participants chose to engage objects when they were farther from the city and had a lower probability of being a missile. Results provided continued support for the use of graphical uncertainty representations, even when numeric representations are present.

		Although a number of methods have been proposed for representing uncertainty in spatial information, there has been relatively little testing of how users interpret uncertainty from those methods. Using results of a fuzzy classification of satellite imagery, this study looks at users' perceptions of a number of different methods for visualization of uncertainty. Both relatively expert and novice users are highly successful at determining classification uncertainty among pixels when shown in greyscale images and histograms, as well as having moderate success with random animations. Viewers considered that although random animation is a good method of showing overall classification uncertainty, greyscale images are a better way to extract specific information. Serial animation was not widely appreciated. In general, the accuracy of answers to specific questions was greatly improved when linked views and ancillary graphic information were available. All the methods examined in this study, in short, were relatively successful, with the exception of serial animation.

		In this paper, we present two novel texture-based techniques to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection perpendicular to the flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the density of flow representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multi-frequency noise approach.

		There is a gulf between the rhetoric in visualization about the importance of uncertainty, and the practice of visualization in which uncertainty is rarely seen other than as a laboratory exercise. We reflect on why something viewed as fundamental in science and engineering is rarely if ever adopted in visualization practice. Our analysis is informed both by research progress and by our own experience in an ongoing industrial case study on modelling and mapping underground assets, where it would appear that uncertainty plays a major role. In this case study, we try to identify promoting and limiting factors. We conclude that the value of uncertainty visualization is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data itself, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the depiction of this data can generate. We hope to broaden the discussion on the utility of uncertainty in visualization from the purely technical and perceptual issues to social and organizational factors.

		We report on results of a series of user studies on the perception of four visual variables that are commonly used in the literature to depict uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first formal evaluation of the use of these variables to facilitate an easier reading of uncertainty in visualizations that rely on line graphical primitives. In addition to blur, dashing and grayscale, we investigate the use of `sketchiness' as a visual variable because it conveys visual impreciseness that may be associated with data quality. Inspired by work in non-photorealistic rendering and by the features of hand-drawn lines, we generate line trajectories that resemble hand-drawn strokes of various levels of proficiency-ranging from child to adult strokes-where the amount of perturbations in the line corresponds to the level of uncertainty in the data. Our results show that sketchiness is a viable alternative for the visualization of uncertainty in lines and is as intuitive as blur; although people subjectively prefer dashing style over blur, grayscale and sketchiness. We discuss advantages and limitations of each technique and conclude with design considerations on how to deploy these visual variables to effectively depict various levels of uncertainty for line marks.

		Fiber tracking of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data offers a unique insight into the three-dimensional organisation of white matter structures in the living brain. However, fiber tracking algorithms require a number of user-defined input parameters that strongly affect the output results. Usually the fiber tracking parameters are set once and are then re-used for several patient datasets. However, the stability of the chosen parameters is not evaluated and a small change in the parameter values can give very different results. The user remains completely unaware of such effects. Furthermore, it is difficult to reproduce output results between different users. We propose a visualization tool that allows the user to visually explore how small variations in parameter values affect the output of fiber tracking. With this knowledge the user cannot only assess the stability of commonly used parameter values but also evaluate in a more reliable way the output results between different patients. Existing tools do not provide such information. A small user evaluation of our tool has been done to show the potential of the technique.

		This article reviews the evolution, communication, and differing interpretations of the National Hurricane Center's \"cone of uncertainty\" hurricane forecast graphic. It concludes with a discussion of this graphic from the perspective of risk communication theory. The 2004 hurricane season, in which five named storms struck Florida, demonstrated that hurricane forecast graphics, despite admirable attempts by the forecast community to make user-friendly products, are still subject to misinterpretation by many members of the public. This exploratory analysis draws upon interviews with key government officials and media figures, archival research of Florida newspapers, analysis of 962 public comments on the National Hurricane Center's cone of uncertainty graphic, a separate multiagency study of 2004 hurricane behavior, and relevant risk communication literature, to identify several characteristics of this graphic that likely contribute to public misinterpretation. Forecast providers should consider more formal, rigorous pretesting of forecast graphics, using standard social science techniques, in order to minimize the probability of misinterpretation.

		Most visualization techniques have been designed on the assumption that the data to be represented are free from uncertainty. Yet this is rarely the case. Recently the visualization community has risen to the challenge of incorporating an indication of uncertainty into visual representations, and in this article we review their work. We place the work in the context of a reference model for data visualization, that sees data pass through a pipeline of processes. This allows us to distinguish the visualization of uncertainty - which considers how we depict uncertainty specified with the data - and the uncertainty of visualization - which considers how much inaccuracy occurs as we process data through the pipeline. It has taken some time for uncertain visualization methods to be developed, and we explore why uncertainty visualization is hard - one explanation is that we typically need to find another display dimension and we may have used these up already! To organise the material we return to a typology developed by one of us in the early days of visualization, and make use of this to present a catalogue of visualization techniques describing the research that has been done to extend each method to handle uncertainty. Finally we note the responsibility on us all to incorporate any known uncertainty into a visualization, so that integrity of the discipline is maintained.

		Research into the visualisation of imprecise data is a relatively new field in visualisation. Work is beginning to appear detailing the process of visualising uncertainty in data. Continuing previous work by the author, this paper seeks to extend techniques used to visualise uncertainty from the spatial to the temporal domain, by using visual vibrations to indicate the level of imprecision at a visualised data point. The paper contains an analysis of the present visual features used to indicate imprecision, and then details a methodology for using visual vibrations to display the uncertainty contained in visualised data. Novel additions include addressing chart junk issues outlined by Tufte, additions of perceptual factors and extension to stereo vision applications.

		Visitation maps are an effective means to analyze the frequency of similar occurrences in large sets of uncertain particle trajectories. A visitation map counts for every cell the number of trajectories passing through this cell, and it can then be used to visualize pathways of a certain visitation percentage. In this paper, we introduce an interactive method for the construction and visualization of high-resolution 3D visitation maps for large numbers of trajectories. To achieve this we employ functionality on recent GPUs to efficiently voxelize particle trajectories into a 3D texture map. In this map we visualize envelopes enclosing particle pathways that are followed by a certain percentage of particles using direct volume rendering techniques. By combining visitation map construction with GPU-based Monte-Carlo particle tracing we can even demonstrate the instant construction of a visitation map from a given vector field. To facilitate the visualization of safety regions around possible trajectories, we further generate Euclidean distance transform volumes to these trajectories on the fly. We demonstrate the application of our approach for visualizing the variation of stream lines in 3D flows due to different numerical integration schemes or errors introduced through data transformation operations, as well as for visualizing envelopes of probabilistic fiber bundles in DTI tractography.

		Information on data quality is important for effective use of GIS data. It impacts the credibility of data representation and the confidence that is attached to data interpretations. It impacts the reliability of interpretations and thus decision making based on GIS modeling and data exploration. A number of impediments to representing data quality can be cited, including impediments to definition and assessment, to attribution in a database, and to graphical depiction. This paper elaborates on impediments to representing data quality. The discussion provides a window through which the complexity of representing data quality may be viewed, and to introduce current research efforts and avenues for further research addressing each impediment. L'information sur la qualité des données est importante pour un usage des données des SIG. Elle a un impact sur la crédibilité de la représentation des données et la confiance que l'on attache à l'interprétation des données. Elle a un impact sur la fiabilité de l'interprétation et par conséquent, sur la prise de décision basée sur la modélisation et l'exploration des données des SIG. On peut citer un certain nombre d'obstacles à la représentation de la qualité des données, dont des obstacles a la définition et l'évaluation, à l'attribution dans une base de données et à la représentation graphique. Dans cet article, on élabore sur les obstacles à la représentation de la qualité des données. La discussion ouvre une fentre par laquelle on peut voir la complexité de représenter la qualité des données et souligne les efforts actuels en recherche ainsi que les avenues de recherche supplémentaire pour traiter chaque obstacle.

		In many applications of scientific visualization, a large quantity of data is being processed and displayed in order to enable a viewer to make informed and effective decisions. Since little data is perfect, there is almost always some degree of associated uncertainty. This uncertainty is an important part of the data and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data. Uncertainty, however, should not overshadow the data values. Many methods that address the problem of visualizing data with uncertainty can distort the data and emphasize areas with uncertain values. We have developed a method for showing the uncertainty information together with data with minimal distraction. This method uses procedurally generated annotations which are deformed according to the uncertainty information. As another possible technique we propose distorting glyphs according to the uncertainty information.

		Aggregating items can simplify the display of huge quantities of data values at the cost of losing information about the attribute values of the individual items. We propose a distribution glyph, in both two- and three-dimensional forms, which specically addresses the concept of how the aggregated data is distributed over the possible range of values. It is capable of displaying distribution, variability and extent information for up to four attributes at a time of multivariate, clustered data. User studies validate the concept, showing that both glyphs are just as good as raw data and the 3D glyph is better for answering some questions.

		Invented by Spear in 1952 and popularized by Tukey in 1977, the box plot is widely used for displaying and comparing samples of continuous observations. Despite its popularity, it is less effective for showing shape behaviour of distributions, particularly bimodality. Using robust estimators of data skewness and kurtosis to classify the distribution into categories, we suggest a simple enhancement for indicating bimodality, central peakedness, and skewness. We also suggest a new graphical method for displaying confidence intervals when comparing several samples of continuous data.

		Visualization has become a vital tool for representing the results of scientific models in decision support applications. Both the raw data and the models from which these visualizations are derived usually have considerable uncertainty associated with them. Decision-makers are typically presented with results from these models with little or no insight as to the reliability of the information shown. For effective decisions to be made, a decision support system should allow collaborative participation from scientists and decision-makers, and it should display the locations, magnitudes, and sources of uncertainty in the results. This research work discusses a software application for visualizing the results of a water balance model and its associated uncertainty. The effectiveness of the application and its visual presentation methods were incrementally tested and improved through usability engineering principles.

		Lattice graphs are used as underlying data structures in many statistical processing systems, including natural language processing. Lattices compactly represent multiple possible outputs and are usually hidden from users. We present a novel visualization intended to reveal the uncertainty and variability inherent in statistically-derived lattice structures. Applications such as machine translation and automated speech recognition typically present users with a best-guess about the appropriate output, with apparent complete confidence. Through case studies we show how our visualization uses a hybrid layout along with varying transparency, colour, and size to reveal the lattice structure, expose the inherent uncertainty in statistical processing, and help users make better-informed decisions about statistically-derived outputs.

		We present a new method to visualize uncertain scalar data fields by combining color scale visualization techniques with animated, perceptually adapted Perlin noise. The parameters of the Perlin noise are controlled by the uncertainty information to produce animated patterns showing local data value and quality. In order to precisely control the perception of the noise patterns, we perform a psychophysical evaluation of contrast sensitivity thresholds for a set of Perlin noise stimuli. We validate and extend this evaluation using an existing computational model. This allows us to predict the perception of the uncertainty noise patterns for arbitrary choices of parameters. We demonstrate and discuss the efficiency and the benefits of our method with various settings, color maps and data sets.

		Visual analytics has become an important tool for gaining insight on large and complex collections of data. Numerous statistical tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation. We show that data transformations, such as regression, principal component analysis and k-means clustering, can be adapted to account for uncertainty. This framework leads to better visualizations that improve the decision-making process and help analysts gain insight on the analytic process itself.

		Considerable effort has been devoted over the years to fighting uncertainty in geographic information in its different manifestations. Thus far, research on handling inaccuracy, fuzziness, error and related issues has focused for the most part on problems with spatial data and their direct products, typically representations of spatial objects or fields. This paper seeks to broaden the discussion of uncertainty in the geospatial domain by shifting the focus from information to knowledge. It turns out that there is a surprising number of things that we cannot know (or questions we cannot answer) that are not the result of imperfect information. Forms of not knowing are pervasive in domains as diverse as mathematics, logic, physics, and linguistics, and are apparently irreducible. This being the case it may help to explore how these realms of ignorance may affect our efforts. The paper distinguishes three different modes or forms of geospatial knowledge production, and argues that each of them has built-in imperfections, for reasons of logical principle and not just empirical fact. While much can and needs to be done to manage and resolve uncertainties where possible, I argue for accepting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of complex knowledge and not just a flaw that needs to be excised.

While the error cone is one of the primary tools used by officials, and the general public, to make emergency response decisions, the uncertainty underlying this display can be easily misunderstood. This paper explores the design of an alternate display that provides a continually updated set of possible hurricane tracks, whose ensemble distribution closely matches the underlying statistics of a hurricane prediction. We explain the underlying algorithm and data structures, and demonstrate how our displays compare with the error cone. Finally, we review the design and results of a user study that we conducted as a preliminary test of the efficacy of our approach in communicating prediction uncertainty.

		Uncertainty is an intrinsic part of any visual representation in visualization, no matter how precise the input data. Existing research on uncertainty in visualization mainly focuses on depicting data-space uncertainty in a visual form. Uncertainty is thus often seen as a problem to deal with, in the data, and something to be avoided if possible. In this paper, we highlight the need for analyzing visual uncertainty in order to design more effective visual representations. We study various forms of uncertainty in the visual representation of parallel coordinates and propose a taxonomy for categorizing them. By building a taxonomy, we aim to identify different sources of uncertainty in the screen space and relate them to different effects of uncertainty upon the user. We examine the literature on parallel coordinates and apply our taxonomy to categorize various techniques for reducing uncertainty. In addition, we consider uncertainty from a different perspective by identifying cases where increasing certain forms of uncertainty may even be useful, with respect to task, data type and analysis scenario. This work suggests that uncertainty is a feature that can be both useful and problematic in visualization, and it is beneficial to augment an information visualization pipeline with a facility for visual uncertainty analysis.

Slope stability modelling is utilized as a vehicle to bring together uncertainties in categorical spatial data and continuous spatial data. A variety of static visualization methods are discussed, as well as the implications of using an interactive animated display to explore multiple realizations of a continuous surface. The results indicate that careful definitions of allowable uncertainty, and the implications thereof, are required to calibrate an interactive animation that will be utilized by non-specialists. It is argued that this holds particularly true in the situation of risk management decisions.

		Uncertainty visualization is a research area that integrates visualization with the study of uncertainty. Many techniques have been developed for representing uncertainty, and there have been many participant-based empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of specific techniques. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that uncertainty visualization influences, or results in, different decisions. Through a human-subjects experiment, this research evaluates whether specific uncertainty visualization methods, including texture and value, influence decisions and a users confidence in their decisions. The results of this study indicate that uncertainty visualization may effect decisions, but the degree of influence is affected by how the uncertainty is expressed.

		The importance of quantifying and representing uncertainty in geographic data is well recognized in geography. Many techniques have been developed for representing uncertainty, and there have been many participant-based empirical studies evaluating the effectiveness of specific techniques. Speed and accuracy of response are often typical dependent variables in these empirical studies. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that uncertainty visualization influences, or results in, different decisions. Through a human-subjects experiment, this research evaluates whether specific uncertainty visualization methods, including texture and value, influence decisions and a users' confidence in those decisions. The results of this study indicate that uncertainty visualization may effect decisions, but that the degree of influence may be governed by the decision task and not solely by the specific visualization technique used to communicate uncertainty information. The results of this research will support future research into whether the type of decision task should inform the methods for visualizing uncertainty in decision support applications.

		Decision makers increasingly rely on science to inform public policy decisionmaking. Although this integration of science and policy offers the potential to support more informed decisions, scientific results are often not provided in a manner usable to decision makers. When faced with highly uncertain conditions, such as climate change, communicating science in a usable manner becomes even more important. In decision support settings, visualization of geographic information offers a powerful means to communicate uncertain science to decision makers. However, building believable representations does not provide a complete understanding of the potential consequences of decisions. Developing uncertainty representations to reflect the processes of decision-making under uncertainty offers a means to provide insight into the relationships between decisions, uncertainty, and outcomes (consequences of policy decisions). Yet, visualizations often avoid the explicit inclusion of contextual information, such as explanations of risk and uncertainty. This research makes a distinction between explicit and implicit uncertainty for visualization in decision support. In explicit visualization, uncertainty is conceived of, and evaluated as, unique information, related to, but not the same as, the underlying data. Implicit visualizations embed uncertainty information into the representation, instead of expressing uncertainty as separate or additional data. When reframing uncertainty in this way, the relationship between uncertainty, outcomes and decisions is emphasized over explicit representation frameworks that dissociate the method from the user. This paper presents an implicit method for visualizing the impact of climate change uncertainty on policy outcomes in a water model for a hypothetical metropolitan area. The effectiveness of this method for visualizing the relationship between uncertainty and policy impacts was evaluated through a human subject test. The paper reports on the results of the pilot study and how this method compares to methods for explicitly visualizing uncertainty.

The goal is to produce volume rendered images that depict regions of high (or low) uncertainty in the data. The first method involves incorporating the uncertainty information directly into the volume rendering equation. The second method involves post-processing information of volume rendered images to composite uncertainty information. We present some initial findings on what mappings provide qualitatively satisfactory results and what mappings do not. Results are considered satisfactory if the user can identify regions of high or low uncertainty in the rendered image. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.

		Increasingly, more importance is placed on the uncertainty information of data being displayed. This paper focuses on techniques for visualizing 3D scalar data sets with corresponding uncertainty information at each point which is also represented as a scalar value. In Djurcilov (in: D. Ebert, J.M. Favre, R. Peikert (Eds.), Data Visualization 2001, Springer, Berlin, 2001), we presented two general methods (inline DVR approach and a post-processing approach) for carrying out this task. The first method involves incorporating the uncertainty information directly into the volume rendering equation. The second method involves post-processing information of volume rendered images to composite uncertainty information. Here, we provide further improvements to those techniques primarily by showing the depth cues for the uncertainty, and also better transfer function selections.

		Uncertainty is inherent in all real work contexts; it creates ambiguities that make decision making difficult. To help decision makers manage ambiguity, the authors developed and evaluated a domain-independent decision support system (DSS), the Uncertainty DSS. It is designed to help decision makers recognize situations in which uncertainty creates ambiguity in their choices and to identify information that can help reduce that ambiguity. It does so by providing an uncertainty visualization, which shows when the range of possible values for two or more alternatives overlap, indicating that one cannot identify the best alternative given the current information. To evaluate the Uncertainty DSS, the authors created a pared-down version, the Certainty DSS, which provides no uncertainty visualizations. They recruited 22 engineering designers and asked them compare alternative designs from real, ongoing design projects using no DSS, the Certainty DSS, and the Uncertainty DSS. The authors found that without the visualizations, participants did not distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous choices. However, the Uncertainty DSS improved participants' ability to recognize ambiguous decision situations. Additionally, it increased the likelihood that participants would form plans to seek clarifying information. These results suggest that a relatively simple visualization can change the way in which designers think about decision choices.

		Traditionally, hard copy maps were the main source of spatial information for geographical interpretation and analysis. In the past two decades this situation has changed rapidly due to a significant growth in the processing and analysis of digital data. Hard copy maps are now often regarded as no longer of the required standard of accuracy and are being replaced by digital spatial databases, which become the ultimate source of geographical data. However, these databases often contain spatial information of inadequate quality. Error is frequently introduced by data compilation methods and later propagated through various spatial operations. This has an impact on the reliability of spatial databases and creates an urgent need for data quality visualisation.

		Understanding and representing geographical information uncertainty poses a significant challenge in geographical information science (GIScience) research. The concept of information uncertainty is not well defined and has different interpretations across many disciplines of knowledge. Ambiguous terminology used in uncertainty characterisation is one of the impediments to effective representation of information uncertainty. The development of representation tools to assist researchers in understanding and dealing with geographical information uncertainty has been underway for over a decade. However, these efforts lack comprehensiveness in their approach to representing information uncertainty by not considering all known or desirable factors that influence visualisation of information uncertainty for a particular purpose.
    This paper examines the nature of geographical information uncertainty by briefly discussing the concept of uncertainty and its relevance in GIScience. The challenge of representing geographical information uncertainty in a comprehensive way is identified and a strategy that involves considering all known or desirable parameters that influence representation of uncertainty for a particular purpose is proposed.

		Several techniques have been proposed for displaying data certainty on maps, but few have been empirically tested for effectiveness. While it is important to make data certainty information easily accessible, the addition of such data should not unduly increase map complexity. Thus, it becomes important for cartographers to examine the available methods for displaying this aspect of metadata and to test each for its effectiveness. The focus of this study was the display of data certainty information on graduated circle maps. Four types of accuracy indicators were evaluated for their effectiveness in communicating data certainty information. Two were traditional accuracy indicators: reliability diagrams and legend statements. Two were bivariate in form, one using a value-size combination and the other mimicking the idea of focus by varying the line value of the graduated circles to suggest a fading of symbolization for least certain data. The study was designed to assess whether subjects could identify data certainty information on test maps, and evaluate how accurately and confidently they could extract and interpret both thematic and data certainty information. Mean accuracy and confidence rates were compared for maps using different accuracy indicators to evaluate their relative effectiveness. Results suggest that subjects had most difficulty identifying and extracting data certainty information using maps that employed legend statements. They were most successful when data certainty was wedded to thematic data on the map using the bivariate accuracy indicator that mimicked the concept of focus. Identification and extraction of thematic data values were not significantly affected by choice of accuracy indicator.

		This paper examines methodologies for dynamically displaying information about uncertainty. Modeling uncertainty in elevation data results in the generation of dozens or hundreds of realizations of the elevation surface. Producing animations of these surfaces is an approach to exploratory data visualization that may assist the researcher in understanding the effect of uncertainty on spatial applications as well as in communicating the results of the research to a wider audience. A nonlinear method for interpolation between the surface realizations is introduced which allows for smooth animation while maintaining the surface characteristics prescribed by the uncertainty model.

		Visual representations of isosurfaces are ubiquitous in the scientific and engineering literature. In this paper, we present techniques to assess the behavior of isosurface extraction codes. Where applicable, these techniques allow us to distinguish whether anomalies in isosurface features can be attributed to the underlying physical process or to artifacts from the extraction process. Such scientific scrutiny is at the heart of verifiable visualization - subjecting visualization algorithms to the same verification process that is used in other components of the scientific pipeline. More concretely, we derive formulas for the expected order of accuracy (or convergence rate) of several isosurface features, and compare them to experimentally observed results in the selected codes. This technique is practical: in two cases, it exposed actual problems in implementations. We provide the reader with the range of responses they can expect to encounter with isosurface techniques, both under ldquonormal operating conditionsrdquo and also under adverse conditions. Armed with this information - the results of the verification process - practitioners can judiciously select the isosurface extraction technique appropriate for their problem of interest, and have confidence in its behavior.

		As users of maps we are dependent upon their veracity and by extension the reliability of the data they contain. Several research projects have explored possible methods of visually representing data certainty, a kind of metadata; methods considered include depicting the metadata as a map that is separate from the data map, imbedding the metadata into the data map, and creating an interactive environment allowing simultaneous viewing of both data and metadata. A practical consideration, as we develop methods for graphic depiction of data reliability, is the reaction to and acceptance of proposed methods by the map user. This research studied how maps containing graphically depicted reliability information are used. Potential \"usability\" of the cartographic display of data reliability is explored by the type of map user (novices versus experts, and males versus females) and the type of map use (assessment of map reliability, confidence in data reliability assessments, and ability to judge the proportion of the areas within the map containing highly reliable data). This study addressed these issues by exploring and analyzing subject responses to an interactive cartographic display of data and its level of reliability. The graphic depiction of reliability information was found to be accessible and comprehensible by all subjects; novice or expert, and male or female. Two methods of combining data and reliability information, as a composite static display and as an animation, were both found to be helpful by the subjects tested. Two other methods of obtaining reliability information, a map displaying only reliability information and an interactive "toggling" between the data and reliability information were not found to be as efficient or effective as the combination methods.

		We present a system for visualizing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data sets. Using MRS, radiologists generate multiple 3D scalar fields of metabolite concentrations within the brain and compare them to anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. By understanding the relationship between metabolic makeup and anatomical structure, radiologists hope to better diagnose and treat tumors and lesions. Our system consists of three linked visualizations: a spatial glyph-based technique we call Scaled Data-Driven Spheres, a parallel coordinates visualization augmented to incorporate uncertainty in the data, and a slice plane for accurate data value extraction. The parallel coordinates visualization uses specialized brush interactions designed to help users identify nontrivial linear relationships between scalar fields. We describe two novel contributions to parallel coordinates visualizations: linear function brushing and new axis construction. Users have discovered significant relationships among metabolites and anatomy by linking interactions between the three visualizations.

		Conveying data uncertainty in visualizations is crucial for preventing viewers from drawing conclusions based on untrustworthy data points. This paper proposes a methodology for efficiently generating density plots of uncertain multivariate data sets that draws viewers to preattentively identify values of high certainty while not calling attention to uncertain values. We demonstrate how to augment scatter plots and parallel coordinates plots to incorporate statistically modeled uncertainty and show how to integrate them with existing multivariate analysis techniques, including outlier detection and interactive brushing. Computing high quality density plots can be expensive for large data sets, so we also describe a probabilistic plotting technique that summarizes the data without requiring explicit density plot computation. These techniques have been useful for identifying brain tumors in multivariate magnetic resonance spectroscopy data and we describe how to extend them to visualize ensemble data sets.

		Understanding how to display effectively uncertain information has become increasingly important as decision aids can provide operators with situational estimates and their associated uncertainty. The paper describes two studies in which degraded or blended icons were used to convey uncertainty regarding the identity of a radar contact as hostile or friendly. A classification study first showed that participants could sort, order and rank icons from ®ve sets intended to represent different levels of uncertainty. Three icon sets were selected for further study in an experiment in which participants had to identify the status of contacts as either hostile or friendly. Contacts and probabilistic estimates of their identities were depicted on a simulated radar screen in one of three ways: with degraded icons and probabilities, with non-degraded icons and probabilities and with degraded icons only. Results showed that participants using displays with only degraded icons performed better on some measures and as well on other measures, than the other tested conditions. These results are significant because they indicate both that people can understand uncertainty conveyed through such a manner and thus that the use of distorted or degraded images may be a viable alternative to convey situational uncertainty.

		In order to assess the reliability of volume rendering, it is necessary to consider the uncertainty associated with the volume data and how it is propagated through the volume rendering algorithm, as well as the contribution to uncertainty from the rendering algorithm itself. In this work, we show how to apply concepts from the field of reliable computing in order to build a framework for management of uncertainty in volume rendering, with the result being a self-validating computational model to compute a posteriori uncertainty bounds. We begin by adopting a coherent, unifying possibility-based representation of uncertainty that is able to capture the various forms of uncertainty that appear in visualization, including variability, imprecision, and fuzziness. Next, we extend the concept of the fuzzy transform in order to derive rules for accumulation and propagation of uncertainty. This representation and propagation of uncertainty together constitute an automated framework for management of uncertainty in visualization, which we then apply to volume rendering. The result, which we call fuzzy volume rendering, is an uncertainty-aware rendering algorithm able to produce more complete depictions of the volume data, thereby allowing more reliable conclusions and informed decisions. Finally, we compare approaches for self-validated computation in volume rendering, demonstrating that our chosen method has the ability to handle complex uncertainty while maintaining efficiency.

		Correlation and covariance matrices provide the basis for all classical multivariate techniques. Many statistical tools exist for analyzing their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of techniques we subsume under the name \"corrgram,\" based on two main schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that \"similar\" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.

These alternative constructions arise from different choices in computing quartiles and the fences that determine whether an observation is “outside” and thus plotted individually. We examine these alternatives and their consequences, discuss related background for boxplots (such as the probability that a sample contains one or more outside observations and the average proportion of outside observations in a sample), and offer recommendations that lead to a single standard form of the boxplot.

		This paper addresses the modelling of uncertainty in an integrated geographic information system GIS , specifically focused on the fusion of activities between GIS and remote sensing. As data is abstracted from its ‘raw’ form to the higher representations used by GIS, it passes through a number of different conceptual data models via a series of transformations. Each model and each transformation process contributes to the overall uncertainty present within the data. The issues that this paper addresses are threefold. Firstly, a description of various models of geographic space is given in terms of the inherent uncertainty characteristics that apply; this is then worked into a simple formalism. Secondly, the various transformation processes that are used to form geographic classes or objects from image data are described, and their effects on the uncertainty properties of data are stated. Thirdly, using the formalism to describe the transformation processes, a framework for the propagation of uncertainty through an integrated GIS is derived. By way of a summary, a table describing sources of accumulated uncertainty across four underlying models of geographic space is derived.

The Landsat TM data are from the Yellow River Delta, Shandong Province, China. Image classification with MLC and FCM provides the probability vector and fuzzy membership vector of each pixel. Based on these vectors, the Shannon's entropy (S.E.) of each pixel is calculated. PCPs are then produced for each classification output. The PCP axes denote the posterior probability vector and fuzzy membership vector and two additional axes represent S.E. and the associated degree of uncertainty. The PCPs highlight the distribution of probability values of different land cover types for each pixel, and also reflect the status of pixels with different degrees of uncertainty. Brushing functionality is then added to PCP visualization in order to highlight selected pixels of interest. This not only reduces the visualization uncertainty, but also provides invaluable information on the positional and spectral characteristics of targeted pixels.

		Mathematical models of biophysical phenomena have proven useful in the reconstruction of experimental data and prediction of biological behavior. By quantifying the sensitivity of a model to certain parameters, one can place an appropriate amount of emphasis in the accuracy with which those parameters are determined. In addition, investigation of stochastic parameters can lead to a greater understanding of the behavior captured by the model. This can lead to possible model reductions, or point out shortcomings to be addressed. We present polynomial chaos as a computationally efficient alternative to Monte Carlo for assessing the impact of stochastically distributed parameters on the model predictionsof several cardiac electrophysiological models.

		Because numerical simulation parameters may significantly influence the accuracy of the results, evaluating the sensitivity of simulation results to variations in parameters is essential. Although the field of sensitivity analysis is well developed, systematic application of such methods to complex biological models is limited due to the associated high computational costs and the substantial technical challenges for implementation. In the specific case of the forward problem in electrocardiography, the lack of robust, feasible, and comprehensive sensitivity analysis has left many aspects of the problem unresolved and subject to empirical and intuitive evaluation rather than sound, quantitative investigation. In this study, we have developed a systematic, stochastic approach to the analysis of sensitivity of the forward problem of electrocardiography to the parameter of inhomogeneous tissue conductivity. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional, inhomogeneous, geometric model of a slice through the human thorax. We assigned probability density functions for various organ conductivities and applied stochastic finite elements based on the generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) method to obtain the standard deviation of the resulting stochastic torso potentials. This method utilizes a spectral representation of the stochastic process to obtain numerically accurate stochastic solutions in a fraction of the time required when employing classic Monte Carlo methods. We have shown that a systematic study of sensitivity is not only easily feasible with the gPC-SG approach but can also provide valuable insight into characteristics of the specific simulation.

		Showing uncertainties of geospatial data in maps in a useful and comprehensible way for skilled and unskilled users is a problem that is still not solved ultimately. To evaluate the usability of some commonly used visualisation techniques with a special focus on interactivity, an explorative study has been conducted with ten interviewees with a geosciences background. Each participant was asked to solve tasks and give personal opinions on three methods applied to the same data set. As an outcome, uncertainty was considered as being helpful for decision making in general. The results also show a clear preference for the simplest method of displaying value and uncertainty in adjacent maps, whereas the more sophisticated Aguila visualisation system was judged as helpful for expert users. Interactivity for the methods was preferred by the majority of the users.

		Visualization methods to show uncertainties in geospatial data are important tools for communication. Methods have been mainly developed for marginal probability distribution functions (pdfs) describing uncertainties independently for each location in space and time. Often uncertainties can be described better by joint pdfs, including the spatio-temporal dependencies of uncertainties. In this paper, methods for visualization of marginal distributions for space-time grids or features were compared to the case where the full joint distribution needs to be considered in order to find typical or rare spatial or spatio-temporal patterns, such as in ensemble weather forecasts. A number of statistical methods to sample representative realizations from a collection of model ensembles based on the spatio-temporal dependencies such as Mahalanobis distance were investigated and compared. We conclude that taking the full joint probability into account by showing a set of selected ensembles besides visualization methods using marginal distributions is helpful to understand the spatio-temporal structure.

This approach was applied to sea-surface temperature data and was found to be effective in showing fuzzy details embedded in the data and in drawing the viewer's attention. This approach and methods could play a significant role in the display of browse products for massive data and information systems.

Moreover, in the synthetic digital world anybody can visualize anything in any shape or form, disregarding how users might perceive or get the information. Worse, as technology develops, it becomes easier to do so. Understanding the data and information and reaching sound decisions require knowing what pieces of information or data are accurate, complete, consistent, and certain, identifying which are not and by how much, and making the presentation accurate.

Such a robust plot shows location, scale, correlation, and a resistant regression line. Alternative constructions are compared in terms of efficiency of the relevant parameters. Additional properties are given and recommendations made. Emphasis is given to the bi-variate biweight M estimator.

		Decision making often depends on the analysis and evaluation of large amounts of data for which information visualization proved to be a valuable approach. The recognition of uncertainty in the data is crucial and it should therefore be appropriately represented. However, suitable methods for its visualization are in many cases not available. This paper provides a general view on uncertainty with respect to a widely accepted information model. Out of this view it explains why the recognition of uncertainty plays an important role for decisions, and it depicts available but especially missing visualization concepts today, e.g. for the display of uncertain relationships. To fill that gap new ideas are derived for an improved visual decision support.

		Visualization is a valuable approach to the exploration and communication of large data sets. In different domains these data sets may contain an unavoidable amount of uncertainty that needs to be included in the visualization process to enable the correct cognition of hidden facts. In recent years many different concepts regarding this uncertainty visualization were developed but the topic is still gaining interest. Within this quick development it is difficult to keep track of what is there and what is missing.
		Therefore this paper provides a statement on the position of uncertainty visualization today: It defines the basic concept of uncertainty and discusses sources and necessary measures. It furthermore explains the basic uncertainty visualization process and systematically presents existing approaches to the acquisition and especially to the display of uncertainty that can be transferred to new fields, e.g. the visualization of uncertainty in structures. This leads to the depiction of limits and open questions that partly already are or that are assumed to be the focus of further research in this field.

Examples include environmental pollution borderline identification, identification of the limits of an oil basin, or discrimination between contaminated and healthy tissue in medicine. This paper presents an approach for such visualization using points as display primitives. The approach is to render each polygon as a collection of points and to displace each point from the surface in the direction of the surface normal by an amount proportional to some random number multiplied by the uncertainty level at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudo-coloring and shading to give rise to efficient and revealing visualizations. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries.

		Efficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties is an important topic with many applications in science and engineering. In these applications, the correct course of action may depend not only on the location of a boundary, but on the precision with which that location is known. Examples include environmental pollution borderline detection, oil basin edge characterization, or discrimination between cancerous and healthy tissue in medicine. This paper presents a method for producing visualizations of surfaces with uncertainties using points as display primitives. Our approach is to render the surface as a collection of points and to displace each point from its original location along the surface normal by an amount proportional to the uncertainty at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudocoloring to produce efficient and revealing visualizations. The basic approach is sufficiently flexible to allow natural extensions; we show incorporation of expressive modulation of opacity, change of the stroke primitive, and addition of an underlying polygonal model. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries. The point-based technique is compared to pseudocoloring for a position estimation task in a preliminary user study.

		Though the mediums for visualization are limited, the potential dimensions of a dataset are not. In many areas of scientific study, understanding the correlations between those dimensions and their uncertainties is pivotal to mining useful information from a dataset. Obtaining this insight can necessitate visualizing the many relationships among temporal, spatial, and other dimensionalities of data and its uncertainties. We utilize multiple views for interactive dataset exploration and selection of important features, and we apply those techniques to the unique challenges of cosmological particle datasets. We show how interactivity and incorporation of multiple visualization techniques help overcome the problem of limited visualization dimensions and allow many types of uncertainty to be seen in correlation with other variables.

		If there is one thing that defines and limits our efforts to better understand extreme and rare events it is uncertainty. Uncertainty arises from both an imperfect understanding of the rare events and processes we wish to study (e.g., terrorism, natural hazards), and the imperfect, out-of-date, and incomplete data we must work with in order to try and understand these events and processes. No data are perfect. However, uncertainty is more than a technical "failing" of our data (e.g., measurement error); it arises, in part, because there are simply some things that are unknowable (Couclelis 2003) or, as Fischer (1999) articulates, may not be knowable with precision (i.e., inherent vagueness).1 Nevertheless, outside of academic circles one rarely sees maps, GIS databases, or visualization systems that acknowledge these fundamental limitations. This omission is problematic because, as MacEachren (1992, p.10) notes: In the early stages of scientific analysis or policy formulation, providing a way for analysts to assess uncertainty in the data they are exploring is critical to the perspectives they form and the approaches they decide to pursue. In the last 15 years, researchers in GIScience have made great advances in defining, measuring, modeling, and visualizing uncertainty and data quality (notably, Buttenfield, Clarke, Goodchild, MacEachren, Fischer, Beard, Ehlschlaeger, see references). Indeed, uncertainty has become a central issue in GIScience research with numerous conference sessions and journal articles devoted to the topic. Despite this sustained attention, a basic question that remains largely unanswered is whether displaying uncertainty helps users. In other words, does displaying uncertainty on maps fundamentally change the way people think and problem-solve and ultimately lead to better decisions? In this paper I will (1) argue why we need answers to these questions, (2) briefly review and synthesize relevant research findings to date, (3) define what constitutes "better decisions," and (4) outline how we might proceed from here.

		Natural resource inventories are more and more based on quantitative spatial methods. The discrete classes of vegetation, soil, land cover etc. can be quantified by using membership maps rather than only crisp delineations. GIS methods to visually explore fuzziness and uncertainty of the prediction maps are clearly needed. The paper presents two relatively new techniques for visualisation of multiple membership maps and uncertainty of spatial prediction methods: Pixel Mixture (PM) and Colour Mixture (CM). The PM assigns classes to sub-pixels relatively to the membership value, while CM calculates average colour taking the memberships as weights. The PM technique appears to be more simple, "user-friendly" and easier to interpret. The CM technique requires a special fuzzy legend that also reflects taxonomic relations and can be therefore considered a double-continuous approach to mapping. The derived saturation of the map calculated using the CM technique gives us insight into the spatial and taxonomic confusion of our map. Both PM and CM can be both applied to visualize the confusion index or relative error together with the maps of estimates. In this case we used brightness correction and white pixels to include the relative uncertainty and confusion. These techniques will be further on developed to produce operational maps to be used in decision-making.

		Paper describes two GIS methods for visualisation of uncertainty associated with spatial prediction of continuous and categorical variables. In the case of continuous variables, the key issue is to visualise both predictions and the prediction error at the same time, while in the case of categorical data, the key issue is to visualise multiple memberships and confusion in-between them. Both methods are based on the Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) colour model and calculations with colours using the colour mixture (CM) concept. The HSI is a psychologically appealing colour model - hue is used to visualise values or taxonomic space and whiteness (paleness) is used to visualise the uncertainty. In the case of continuous variables, a two- dimensional legend was designed to accompany the visualisations - vertical axis (hues) is used to visualise the predicted values and horizontal axis (whiteness) is used to visualise the prediction error. In the case of categorical variables, a circular legend is used - perimeter (hues) defines the taxonomic space and radial distance represents the confusion. The methods are illustrated using two examples: (a) interpolation of soil thickness using regression-kriging and (b) fuzzy k-means classification of landforms classes.

		The paper discusses use of static visualization techniques for representation of uncertainty in spatial prediction models illustrated with examples from soil mapping. The uncertainty of a prediction model, represented with the prediction error, is commonly ignored or only visualized separately from the predictions. Two techniques that can be used to visualize the uncertainty are colour mixing (whitening) and pixel mixing. In both cases, the uncertainty is coded with the white colour and quantitative values are coded with Hues. Additional hybrid static visualization technique (pixel mixing with simulations) that shows both the short-range variation and the overall uncertainty is described. Examples from a case study from Central Iran (4271 km) were used to demonstrate the possible applications and emphasize the importance of visualizing the uncertainty in maps. The soil predictions were made using 118 soil profiles and 16 predictors ranging from terrain parameters to Landsat 7 bands. All variables were mapped using regression-kriging and grid resolution of 100 m. Final maps of texture fractions, EC and organic matter in topsoil were visualized using the whitening, pixel missing and pixel mixing combined with simulations. Visualization of uncertainty allows users to compare success of spatial prediction models for various variables. In this case study, the results showed that there can be quite some differences in the achieved precision of predictions for various variables and that some soil variables need to be collected with much higher inspection density to satisfy the required precision. Visualization of uncertainty also allows users to dynamically improve the precision of predictions by collecting additional samples. Links to scripts that the users can download and use to visualize their datasets are given.

		The American Meteorological Society (AMS) Weather and Climate Enterprise Strategic Implementation Plan for Generating and Communicating Forecast Uncertainty (the Plan) is summarized. The Plan (available on the AMS website at www.ametsoc.org/boardpges/cwce/docs/BEC/ACUF/2011-02-20-ACUF-Final-Report.pdf) is based on and intended to provide a foundation for implementing recent recommendations regarding forecast uncertainty by the National Research Council (NRC), AMS, and World Meteorological Organization. It defines a vision, strategic goals, roles and respon- sibilities, and an implementation road map to guide the weather and climate enterprise (the Enterprise) toward routinely providing the nation with comprehensive, skillful, reliable, and useful information about the uncertainty of weather, water, and climate (hydrometeorological) forecasts. Examples are provided describing how hydrometeorological forecast uncertainty information can improve decisions and outcomes in various socioeconomic areas. The implementation road map defines objectives and tasks that the four sectors comprising the Enterprise (i.e., government, industry, academia, and nongovernmental organizations) should work on in partnership to meet four key, interrelated strategic goals: 1) understand social and physical science aspects of forecast uncertainty; 2) communicate forecast uncertainty information effectively and collaborate with users to assist them in their decision making; 3) generate forecast uncertainty data, products, services, and information; and 4) enable research, development, and operations with necessary information technology and other infrastructure. The Plan endorses the NRC recommendation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, in particular, the National Weather Service, should take the lead in motivating and organizing Enterprise resources and expertise in order to reach the Plan's vision and goals and shift the nation successfully toward a greater understanding and use of forecast uncertainty in decision making.

		A new type of glyph is introduced to visualize unsteady flow with static images, allowing easier analysis of time-dependent phenomena compared to animated visualization. Adopting the visual metaphor of radar displays, this glyph represents flow directions by angles and time by radius in spherical coordinates. Dense seeding of flow radar glyphs on the flow domain naturally lends itself to multi-scale visualization: zoomed-out views show aggregated overviews, zooming-in enables detailed analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics. Uncertainty visualization is supported by extending the glyph to display possible ranges of flow directions. The paper focuses on 2D flow, but includes a discussion of 3D flow as well. Examples from CFD and the field of stochastic hydrogeology show that it is easy to discriminate regions of different spatiotemporal flow behavior and regions of different uncertainty variations in space and time. The examples also demonstrate that parameter studies can be analyzed because the glyph design facilitates comparative visualization. Finally, different variants of interactive GPU-accelerated implementations are discussed.

		There is now increasing agreement that the uncertainty associated with spatial information should be represented to users in a manner that is comprehensive and unambiguous. To assist with this task, researchers have developed a variety of methods to portray spatial uncertainty. While there has been some testing of the effectiveness of these displays, the possible effects of such representations on decisionmaking have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Indeed, studies from the psychological literature indicate that people do not always make the same decisions when presented with the same information, and they can also be sensitive to the effects of presentation, task, and context. This paper examines how the use of four different methods to represent positional uncertainty can affect spatial decisionmaking. The authors found that extremely significant differences in participants' responses were exhibited, depending on the manner in which positional uncertainty was displayed, although little difference was observed in the ability of the participants to comprehend the four display methods. In addition, strong preferences were recorded for certain representations over others.

		The Horwitz formula will tell you if your anticipated uncertainty is such that you will be within the limits of the ballpark with a typical method. The maximum spread obtained by the top-down approach will encompass the "true value" in almost all practical cases. It is usually easier to let nature slip in all the unanticipatable tricks that can befall even the most careful ana- lysts than to valiantly attempt to foresee them beforehand by the budget ap- proach. This is how the uncertainty of the method becomes entangled with the uncertainty of the measurement.

		Digital "softcopy" maps are becoming the norm—replacing static paper maps in applications from wayfinding to scientific research. As a result, the design of interface tools that allow users to manipulate map parameters effectively and efficiently is likely to become as fundamental to cartography as the design of maps themselves. This article presents some principles for the design of interfaces to geo-referenced data. These principles are summarized in a hierarchical approach to interface design with conceptual, operational, and implementational levels. This hierarchical approach leads designers from questions about the goals of the system and the users of that system to the creation of tools to accomplish those goals and interface controls that allow effective interaction with the tools. The article goes on to describe the application of these principles to a prototype geographic visualization system designed for exploration of spatial data sets and visualization of reliability of both data and data abstractions associated with environmental change. The prototype involves a synthesis of concepts and methods derived from cartography, scientific visualization, and exploratory data analysis into a system for exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial decision support.

		Data quality, which refers to correctness, uncertainty, completeness and other aspects of data, has became more and more prevalent and has been addressed across multiple disciplines. Data quality could be introduced and presented in any of the data manipulation processes such as data collection, transformation, and visualization. Data visualization is a process of data mining and analysis using graphical presentation and interpretation. The correctness and completeness of the visualization discoveries to a large extent depend on the quality of the original data. Without the integration of quality information with data presentation, the analysis of data using visualization is incomplete at best and can lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions at worst. This thesis addresses the issue of data quality visualization. Incorporating data quality measures into the data displays is challenging in that the display is apt to be cluttered when faced with multiple dimensions and data records. We investigate both the incorporation of data quality information in traditional multivariate data display techniques as well as develop novel visualization and interaction tools that operate in data quality space. We validate our results using several data sets that have variable quality associated with dimensions, records, and data values.

		Large-scale molecular dynamics (GD) simulations are some of the primary applications running on today's supercomputers. These simulations frequently compute the interactions of millions of atoms over millions of time steps, and petascale simulations will target billion atom simulations in the near future. Visualizing the state of such large-scale simulations poses a significant challenge for both data reduction and perception. Standard tools for 3D visualization of MD simulations -- such as direct visualization of the molecules in their simulated physical arrangement -- eventually grow so dense (with more atoms than screen pixels) that only the volumetric shape of the simulation domain is apparent, rather than its detailed content. In this paper, we describe a method for visualizing simulations of a compound in bulk which we refer to as the ensemble display. An ensemble display is produced by superimposing molecular neighborhoods onto fixed reference molecules. This results in a 3D visualization which preserves inter-molecular distances and angles between pairs of molecules while greatly reducing the visual complexity. We performed human-subjects experiments to test the hypothesis that subjects could deduce a bulk physical property of the simulation (temperature) from the ensemble display more accurately than from other common visualizations of GD simulation. Our results show that temperature estimates under the ensemble display had the least error of the tested visualization techniques.

		In our ongoing quest to convey more information more clearly in a single image, harnessing the full potential of texture for data representation remains an elusive goal. Others have begun excellent work in this area,1-3 and my efforts are inspired by their example. The grail that I seek is a partially ordered multidimensional palette of richly detailed and varying texture patterns that can be used in conjunction with lightness and hue to represent multivariate information. The goal is to facilitate the flexible visual appreciation of the correlations of various quantities across the different dimensions. The approach that I outline here departs a bit from the norm, but is motivated by a desire to proceed more directly from my vision of what I want to achieve, unrestrained by the limitations of the tools I have on hand. In the following discussion, I motivate the adoption of rich, natural textures resembling those from photographic images4 as elemental primitives and sketch some of the approaches that we can take to enhance our understanding of how to effectively harness their properties. My intent here is not to present results, but to expound on the issues and conclude with the questions to which we re still seeking answers.

		In the field of uncertainty quantification, uncertainty in the governing equations may assume two forms: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty can be characterised by known probability distributions whilst epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge of probabilistic information. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the numerical treatment of aleatory uncertainty, little attention has been given to the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a numerical framework for quantification of epistemic uncertainty. The proposed methodology does not require any probabilistic information on uncertain input parameters. The method only necessitates an estimate of the range of the uncertain variables that encapsulates the true range of the input variables with overwhelming probability. To quantify the epistemic uncertainty, we solve an encapsulation problem, which is a solution to the original governing equations defined on the estimated range of the input variables. We discuss solution strategies for solving the encapsulation problem and the sufficient conditions under which the numerical solution can serve as a good estimator for capturing the effects of the epistemic uncertainty. In the case where probability distributions of the epistemic variables become known a posteriori, we can use the information to post-process the solution and evaluate solution statistics. Convergence results are also established for such cases, along with strategies for dealing with mixed aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure and properties of the proposed methodology.

		Two people measuring the same product with the same ruler on different days would probably get different results. This could be because of factors such as a change in the room temperature (important for a metal ruler) or different eyesight capabilities. The two measurements might be equivalent or not, depending upon their individual uncertainties. This concept of uncertainty is a measure of the quality of a measurement and can be vital in many cases. The JCGM/100 series of documents establishes general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty in measurement that can be followed at various levels of accuracy and in many fields - from the shop floor to fundamental research. Therefore, the principles of these Guides are intended to be applicable to a broad spectrum of measurements, including those required for: * maintaining quality control and quality assurance in production; * complying with and enforcing laws and regulations; * conducting basic research, and applied research and development, in science and engineering; * calibrating standards and instruments and performing tests throughout a national measurement system in order to achieve traceability to national standards; * developing, maintaining, and comparing international and national physical reference standards, including reference materials * other metrology-related aspects.

		A statement of measurement uncertainty is indispensable in judging the fitness for purpose of a measured quantity value. At the greengrocery store the customer would be content if, when buying a kilogram of fruit, the scales gave a value within, say, 2 grams of the fruit's actual weight. However, the dimensions of components of the gyroscopes within the inertial navigation systems of commercial aircraft are checked by measurement to parts in a million for correct functioning. Measurement uncertainty is a general concept associated with any measurement and can be used in professional decision processes as well as judging attributes in many domains, both theoretical and experimental. As the tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertainty becomes more important when assessing conformity to these tolerances. Measurement uncertainty plays a central role in quality assessment and quality standards. Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial, commercial, scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental. Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities. Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context of conformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement, and to manage the consequential risks. This document serves as an introduction to measurement uncertainty, the GUM and the related documents indicated in the Foreword. A probabilistic basis for uncertainty evaluation is used. Annex A gives acronyms and initialisms used in this document. In future editions of JCGM 200 (VIM) it is intended to make a clear distinction between the use of the term error as a quantity and as a quantity value. The same statement applies to the term indication. In the current document such a distinction is made. JCGM 200:2008 does not distinguish explicitly between these uses.

		The "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" (GUM) [JCGM 100:2008] is mainly concerned with univariate measurement models, namely models having a single scalar output quantity. However, mod- els with more than one output quantity arise across metrology. The GUM includes examples, from electrical metrology, with three output quantities [JCGM 100:2008 H.2], and thermal metrology, with two output quan- tities [JCGM 100:2008 H.3]. This Supplement to the GUM treats multivariate measurement models, namely models with any number of output quantities. Such quantities are generally mutually correlated because they depend on common input quantities. A generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework [JCGM 100:2008 5] is used to provide estimates of the output quantities, the standard uncertainties associated with the estimates, and covariances associated with pairs of estimates. The input or output quantities in the measurement model may be real or complex. Supplement 1 to the GUM [JCGM 101:2008] is concerned with the propagation of probability distributions [JCGM 101:2008 5] through a measurement model as a basis for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty, and its implementation by a Monte Carlo method [JCGM 101:2008 7]. Like the GUM, it is only concerned with models having a single scalar output quantity [JCGM 101:2008 1]. This Supplement describes a generalization of that Monte Carlo method to obtain a discrete representation of the joint probability distribution for the output quantities of a multivariate model. The discrete representation is then used to provide estimates of the output quantities, and standard uncertainties and covariances associated with those estimates. Appropriate use of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUM uncertainty framework is questionable, namely when (a) linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation, or (b) the probability distribution for the output quantity (or quantities) departs appreciably from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. Guidance is also given on the determination of a coverage region for the output quantities of a multivariate model, the counterpart of a coverage interval for a single scalar output quantity, corresponding to a stipulated coverage probability. The guidance includes the provision of coverage regions that take the form of hyper- ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. A calculation procedure that uses results provided by the Monte Carlo method is also described for obtaining an approximation to the smallest coverage region.

		Visualization techniques benefit fuzzy spatial analysis in at least two aspects. One is in the field of exploratory analysis, and another is in the representation of uncertainty. This paper intends to discuss the first issue. Fuzzy spatial analysis may be distinguished from conventional analysis in that the former is a form of concept analysis which is closer to natural language and the latter in most cases refers to numerical processing. Due to the fuzzy nature of the analysis approach, suitable visualization techniques to support the analysis process are highly needed. In this paper, the fundamentals of fuzzy spatial analysis are outlined and consecutively, the visualization tools supporting the exploration process are focused on. Finally, an approach towards a complete system framework for exploration is presented using some advanced techniques such as the object-oriented system building approach, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and hypertext techniques.

		This paper is intended to provide more insights into intuitive perceptual aspects of colouring uncertainty, based on the perception experiments conducted. In total, five different kinds of colour scales and four bivariate colour schemes were investigated for the representation of uncertainty and data combined with uncertainty respectively. it is concluded that instead of the saturation scale attempted in some previous investigations, a lightness scale starting with white is relatively easily perceived as one of the best solutions. It is shown that a random dot scale, as an alternative to colour scales, provides as intuitively good understanding of uncertainty. it is also shown that bivariate schemes using a random dot scale on both axes, or a random dot scale on one axis and a tint scale on the other, have advantages over spectrally encoded schemes for visualizing data combined with uncertainty, as well as for overlaying of attribute information of different phenomena.

		The linguistic notions such as very low, low, not low, low or medium are commonly used to name classes in current geographic information systems (GIS). These sorts of linguistic notions are frequently utilised in the social sciences as well. There is little doubt that the social sciences require a formal and even a mathematical framework for handling graded categories with blurred boundaries. In the past decades, much effort has been made to model the kind of fuzziness (or possibility) from the field of mathematics. Geographers and GIS professionals have started to treat this issue since a decade ago. This short article provides detailed discussions with a case study on how to visualise fuzziness, involving colour surfaces, coloured contour lines and 3D model simulation. The author's argument is that effective visualisation of fuzzy boundaries will facilitate the understanding of geographic objects with indeterminate boundaries.

		Scientific visualization as currently understood and practiced is still a relatively new discipline. As a result, we visualization researches are not necessarily accustomed to undertaking the sorts of self-examinations that other scientists routinely undergo in relation to their work. Yet if we are to creat a disciplinary culture focused on matters of real scientific importance and committed to real progress, it is essential that we ask ourselves hard questions on an ongoing basis. What are the most important research issues facing us? What underlying assumptions needs to be challenged and perhaps abandoned? What practices need to be reviewed? In this article, I attempt to start a discussion of these issues by proposing a list of top research problems and issues in scientific visualization.

		Diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) permits determination of the dominant orientation of structured tissue within an image voxel. This has led to the development of 2D graphical methods for representing fiber orientation and DT-MRI "tractography," which aims to reconstruct the 3D trajectories of white matter fasciculi. Most contemporary fiber orientation mapping schemes and tractography algorithms employ the directional information contained in the eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor to approximate white matter fiber orientation. However, while the uncertainty associated with every estimate of an eigenvector has long been recognized, no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in vivo have been reported. Here, a method is proposed for determining confidence intervals in fiber orientation from real DT-MRI data using the bootstrap method. This is used to construct maps of the "cone of uncertainty," allowing simultaneous viewing of fiber orientation and its uncertainty, and to examine the relationship between orientation uncertainty and tissue anisotropy.

		Various stages of data processing, including the modeling of scattered volumetric data and the algorithms used to render isosurfaces, can introduce uncertainty or error in the final visualization. Although researchers are aware of the errors that arise during data processing, there still remains no visual framework for evaluating uncertainty in isosurfaces. This paper focuses on the comparison of isosurfaces through UISURF, a visualization system for displaying uncertainty in isosurfaces. UISURF provides visual and statistical information to aid in the evaluation and comparison of isosurfaces and the algorithms used to generate them. Uncertainty is visualized through a series of techniques: overlay, pseudo-coloring, transparency, glyphs, animation, and sonification. Results are presented for comparing isosurfaces generated from different algorithms and those obtained by using different volumetric interpolation models.

		The study reported here asks whether the use of probabilistic information indicating forecast uncertainty improves the quality of deterministic weather decisions. Participants made realistic wind speed forecasts based on historical information in a controlled laboratory setting. They also decided whether it was appropriate to post an advisory for winds greater than 20 kt (10.29 m s1) during the same time intervals and in the same geographic locations. On half of the forecasts each participant also read a color-coded chart showing the probability of winds greater than 20 kt. Participants had a general tendency to post too many advisories in the low probability situations (0%-10%) and too few advisories in very high probability situations (90%-100%). However, the probability product attenuated these biases. When participants used the probability product, they posted fewer advisories when the probability of high winds was low and they posted more advisories when the probability of high winds was high. The difference was due to the probability product alone because the within-subjects design and counterbalancing of forecast dates ruled out alternative explanations. The data suggest that the probability product improved threshold forecast decisions.

		The results of three psychological studies suggest that many people did not understand probability of precipitation (PoP) despite the fact that participants were college undergraduates in the Pacific Northwest, an area with frequent precipitation forecasts. The misunderstanding concerned the class of events to which the probability refers.
		The combined results reported here suggest that some participants thought that the percentage, indicating chance of precipitation, referred instead to the proportion of area or time that precipitation would be observed. More participants chose to take an umbrella or wear a hooded jacket who mistakenly interpreted the forecast as indicating precipitation for more than half of the area or time as compared to those who do not hold this misunderstanding. In addition, performance only improved significantly when PoP was accompanied by a phrase expressing the probability of no precipitation. This suggests a deep-seated misunderstanding that converts the probabilistic forecasts into a deterministic forecast for precipitation with additional information about percent time or area and affects decision making. We conclude that it is important to convey the idea that PoP is a forecast in which it is possible that no precipitation will be observed at all and make suggestions about extending uncertainty forecasts to other parameters.

		Although uncertainty is inherent in weather forecasts, explicit numeric uncertainty estimates are rarely included in public forecasts for fear that they will be misunderstood. Of particular concern are situations in which precautionary action is required at low probabilities, often the case with severe events. At present, a categorical weather warning system is used. The work reported here tested the relative benefits of several forecast formats, comparing decisions made with and without uncertainty forecasts. In three experiments, participants assumed the role of a manager of a road maintenance company in charge of deciding whether to pay to salt the roads and avoid a potential penalty associated with icy conditions. Participants used overnight low temperature forecasts accompanied in some conditions by uncertainty estimates and in others by decision advice comparable to categorical warnings. Results suggested that uncertainty information improved decision quality overall and increased trust in the forecast. Participants with uncertainty forecasts took appropriate precautionary action and withheld unnecessary action more often than did participants using deterministic forecasts. When error in the forecast increased, participants with conventional forecasts were reluctant to act. However, this effect was attenuated by uncertainty forecasts. Providing categorical decision advice alone did not improve decisions. However, combining decision advice with uncertainty estimates resulted in the best performance overall. The results reported here have important implications for the development of forecast formats to increase compliance with severe weather warnings as well as other domains in which one must act in the face of uncertainty.

		Maps of biophysical and geophysical variables using Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite image data are an important component of Earth science. These maps have a single value derived at every grid cell and standard techniques are used to visualize them. Current tools fall short, however, when it is necessary to describe a distribution of values at each grid cell. Distributions may represent a frequency of occurrence over time, frequency of occurrence from multiple runs of an ensemble forecast or possible values from an uncertainty model. We identify these "distribution data sets" and present a case study to visualize such 2D distributions. Distribution data sets are different from multivariate data sets in the sense that the values are for a single variable instead of multiple variables. Data for this case study consists of multiple realizations of percent forest cover, generated using a geostatistical technique that combines ground measurements and satellite imagery to model uncertainty about forest cover. We present two general approaches for analyzing and visualizing such data sets. The first is a pixel-wise analysis of the probability density functions for the 2D image while the second is an analysis of features identified within the image. Such pixel-wise and feature-wise views will give Earth scientists a more complete understanding of distribution data sets. See www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/avis/nasa is for additional information.

		Box plot is a compact representation that encodes the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and quartile information of a distribution. In practice, a single box plot is drawn for each variable of interest. With the advent of more accessible computing power, we are now facing the problem of visualizing data where there is a distribution at each 2D spatial location. Simply extending the box plot technique to distributions over 2D domain is not straightforward. One challenge is reducing the visual clutter if a box plot is drawn over each grid location in the 2D domain. This paper presents and discusses two general approaches, using parametric statistics and shape descriptors, to present 2D distribution data sets. Both approaches provide additional insights compared to the traditional box plot technique.

		NASA is in the business of creating maps for scientific purposes to represent important biophysical or geophysical quantities over space and time. For example, maps of surface temperature over the globe tell scientists where and when the Earth is heating up; regional maps of the greenness of vegetation tell scientists where and when plants are photosynthesizing. There is always uncertainty associated with each value in any such map due to various factors. For example, exactly where on Earth’s surface does a given pixel represent? There could also be cloud and atmospheric contamination in the images taken from satellites. When uncertainty is fully modeled, instead of a single value at each map location, there is a distribution expressing a set of possible outcomes at each location. We consider such distribution data as multi-valued data since it consists of a collection of values about a single variable. Thus, a multi-valued data represents both the data and its uncertainty. We have been working on ways to visualize spatial multi-valued data sets effectively for fields with regularly spaced units or grid cells such as those in NASA’s Earth science applications. Successful uncertainty visualization would improve the understanding of climate change, one of the goals in NASA’s mission to understand and protect our home planet.

		Spatially distributed probability density functions (pdfs) are becoming more relevant to Earth scientists and ecologists because of stochastic models and new sensors that provide numerous realizations or data points per unit area. One source of these data is from multi-return airborne lidar, a type of laser that records multiple returns for each pulse of light sent towards the ground. Data from multi-return lidar is a vital tool in helping us understand the structure of forest canopies over large extents. This paper presents visualization tools to allow scientists to rapidly explore, interpret and discover characteristic distributions within the entire spatial field. The major contribution of this work is a paradigm shift which allows ecologists to think of and analyse their data in terms of full distributions, not just summary statistics. The tools allow scientists to depart from traditional parametric statistical analyses and to associate multimodal distribution characteristics to forest structures. Information on the modality and shape of distributions, previously ignored, can now be visualized as well. Examples are given using data from High Island, southeast Alaska.

		Direct volume rendering of scalar fields uses a transfer function to map locally measured data properties to opacities and colors. The domain of the transfer function is typically the one-dimensional space of scalar data values. This paper advances the use of curvature information in multi-dimensional transfer functions, with a methodology for computing high-quality curvature measurements. The proposed methodology combines an implicit formulation of curvature with convolution-based reconstruction of the field. We give concrete guidelines for implementing the methodology, and illustrate the importance of choosing accurate filters for computing derivatives with convolution. Curvature-based transfer functions are shown to extend the expressivity and utility of volume rendering through contributions in three different application areas: nonphotorealistic volume rendering, surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion, and visualization of isosurface uncertainty.

		The performance effects of graphic and verbal representations of uncertainty were investigated within the context of a spatial problem., Sixteen experienced naval submarine officers acted as decision makers (i.e., submarine commanders) in eight simulated scenarios. Four scenario problems were presented with either a verbal or a graphic representation of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty was controlled by manipulating oceanic conditions and information modeling. The graphic representation of uncertainty resulted in superior range estimates only when the oceanic noise was high and the environmental information was properly modeled. No reliable differences in confidence were observed. These results suggest that for spatial problems, a graphic/spatial representation of uncertainty may considerably improve the judgments of decision makers.

		Visualization users are increasingly in need of techniques for assessing quantitative uncertainty and error in the images produced. Statistical segmentation algorithms compute these quantitative results, yet volume rendering tools typically produce only qualitative imagery via transfer functionbased classification. This paper presents a visualization technique that allows users to interactively explore the uncertainty, risk, and probabilistic decision of surface boundaries. Our approach makes it possible to directly visualize the combined ”fuzzy” classification results from multiple segmentations by combining these data into a unified probabilistic data space. We represent this unified space, the combination of scalar volumes from numerous segmentations, using a novel graph-based dimensionality reduction scheme. The scheme both dramatically reduces the dataset size and is suitable for efficient, high quality, quantitative visualization. Lastly, we show that the statistical risk arising from overlapping segmentations is a robust measure for visualizing features and assigning optical properties.

		The principal goal of visualization is to create a visual representation of complex information and large datasets in order to gain insight and understanding. Our current research focuses on methods for handling uncertainty stemming from data acquisition and algorithmic sources. Most visualization methods, especially those applied to 3D data, implicitly use some form of classification or segmentation to eliminate unimportant regions and illuminate those of interest. The process of classification is inherently uncertain; in many cases the source data contains error and noise, data transformations such as filtering can further introduce and magnify the uncertainty. More advanced classification methods rely on some sort of model or statistical method to determine what is and is not a feature of interest. While these classification methods can model uncertainty or fuzzy probabilistic memberships, they typically only provide discrete, maximum a-posteriori memberships. It is vital that visualization methods provide the user access to uncertainty in classification or image generation if the results of the visualization are to be trusted.

Fifty-two Marines with varying amounts of command-post experience assessed the situation as it developed, determined tactical leverage points, formed a plan of action, and submitted battle orders. Two scenarios were studiedFeach differed in the level of certaintyin the information provided. The tactical decision process was modeled and analyzed in the following sequential, cognitive stages: situation assessment, course of action selection, course of action execution. Results show that the time required to assess the situation was significantlylonger ( po0:05), for the high-experience group than the low-experience group. However, once the assessment was complete, the selection of a course of action (COA) was significantlyfaster for the high-experience group than the low-experience group. In addition, COA selection under conditions of low certaintywas significantlylonger than under conditions of high certainty. Time required for COA execution indicated a significant main effect of experience ( po0:05), a main effect of task certaintyapproaching statistical significance ( p ¼ 0:067), and a statisticallysignificant interaction ( po0:05). These results indicate that the time needed to execute the COA, once determined, is significantlyless for the highlyexperienced individuals under conditions of low certainty. However, under the conditions of high certainty, no statistically significant time differences were found based upon the experience level. The high-experience group was significantly more accurate than the low-experience group for developing an appropriate COA.

		Most existing approaches for spatial uncertainty visualization are concerned with the depiction of local or per-pixel uncertainty measures, such as standard errors of attribute prediction in a spatial interpolation setting or posterior probabilities of class occurrence in a  classification setting. Most vision operations, however, are pattern-detection endeavors, which are by definition multi-pixel in nature. Consequently, per-pixel uncertainty measures cannot adequately characterize  uncertainty in the outcomes of vision operations applied on maps. To overcome the above limitations, a formal quantitative framework for the visualization of  spatial uncertainty is advocated, building on an analogy from engineering systems. A system is a model of some aspect or process of the real world, often approximated by a set of  mathematical equations, which is excited by a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs or model predictions. In a similar fashion, a map user can be viewed as a system: his or her visual perception and cognition are extremely complex operations that via map analyses lead to decisions and actions. In analogy with engineering systems, quantification of the impact of an uncertain input map on vision-related tasks requires that these tasks be applied to a set of alternative input maps, all of which are processed by the user to arrive at a set of possible analysis results. The proposed framework can thus be seen as a two-step data mining endeavor: (i) exploration of the attribute uncertainty model via stochastic simulation by generating alternative, synthetic, attribute realizations, and (ii) exploration the outputs of early-vision operations applied on this set of realizations in meaningful ways that enable the user to distill the uncertainty in these outputs.

		Visualizing uncertainty is a challenging endeavour. Perhaps this is because uncertainty is always calculated or recorded with respect to other primary data. In a sense, uncertainty is more like metadata to primary data. Thus, the act of visualizing the uncertainty has to be supported by an understanding of both the uncertainty itself and the primary data. The primary data and how these data are currently being used act as two constraints on the visualization solution. It is challenging to develop innovative methods to visualize uncertainty given these innate constraints; however, many have begun to foray into this research area.

Like many standard one-dimensional distribution plots, the BLiP plot is capable of displaying individual data values in points or lines and grouped information in lines or boxes. In addition, the BLiP plot includes many new features such as variablewidth plots and several choices of point patterns. The main advantage of the BLiP plot is that it provides users with basic graphical elements in a friendly and flexible environment so that users can, according to their needs, construct anything from a simple, standard plot to a complex, customized plot to best present their data.

To provide a way to show uncertainty in similar hierarchies, we interpreted the differences between two tree structures as uncertainty. We developed a new interactive visualization system called CandidTree that merges two trees into one and visualizes two types of structural uncertainty: location and sub-tree structure uncertainty. We conducted a usability study to identify major usability issues and evaluate how our system works. Another qualitative user study was conducted to see if biologists, who regularly work with hierarchically organized names, are able to use CandidTree to complete tree-comparison tasks. We also assessed the “uncertainty” metric we used.

		This research investigates how the inclusion of attribute certainty in map displays influences GIS modeling and spatial decision support. The goal is to establish empirical evidence documenting graphical guidelines that can be incorporated as GIS system defaults for mapping attribute certainty. Value, texture, and saturation appear as visual variables associated with the depiction of attribute certainty. These three variables, in addition to the level of map detail, are explored in this research. A hypermedia document has been developed to simulate decision makers' use of certainty information for two locational siting tasks: the siting of a park and the siting of an airport. The experiment has been designed to observe the correctness, time, and confidence of both siting decisions. The experiment further determines how variations in symbolizing attribute certainty (by value, saturation, or texture) affect the three variables of correctness, time, and confidence. A third goal focuses on whether the difficulty of the task affects the decision. On a theoretical level, this research uncovers new information about assimilating data quality information into spatial decision support. On a practical level, it establishes symbolization schemes for representing attribute certainty on thematic maps. These should be incorporated as GIS graphical defaults in anticipation of digital data sets that include data quality information. This research is a continuation of a long-standing tradition of empirical research in map design as a paradigm for eliciting and formalizing cartographic knowledge.

		Visualization of uncertainty or error in astrophysical data is seldom available in simulations of astronomical phenomena, and yet almost all rendered attributes possess some degree of uncertainty due to observational error. Uncertainties associated with spatial location typically vary significantly with scale and thus introduce further complexity in the interpretation of a given visualization. This paper introduces effective techniques for visualizing uncertainty in large-scale virtual astrophysical environments. Building upon our previous transparently scalable visualization architecture, we develop tools that enhance the perception and comprehension of uncertainty across wide scale ranges. Our methods include a unified color-coding scheme for representing log-scale distances and percentage errors, an ellipsoid model to represent positional uncertainty, an ellipsoid envelope model to expose trajectory uncertainty, and a magic-glass design supporting the selection of ranges of log-scale distance and uncertainty parameters, as well as an overview mode and a scalable WIM tool for exposing the magnitudes of spatial context and uncertainty.

		This paper is concerned with three questions: How do decision makers conceptualize uncertainty? How do decision makers cope with uncertainty? Are there systematic relationships between different conceptualizations of uncertainty and different methods of coping? To answer these questions we analyzed 102 self-reports of decision-making under uncertainty with an inclusive method of classifying conceptualizations of uncertainty and coping mechanisms developed from the decision-making literature. The results showed that decision makers distinguished among three types of uncertainty: inadequate understanding, incomplete information, and undifferentiated alternatives. To these they applied five strategies of coping: reducing uncertainty, assumption-based reasoning, weighing pros and cons of competing alternatives, suppressing uncertainty, and forestalling. Inadequate understanding was primarily managed by reduction, incomplete information was primarily managed by assumption-based reasoning, and conflict among alternatives was primarily managed by weighing pros and cons. Based on these results and findings from previous studies of naturalistic decision-making we hypothesized a R.A.W.F.S. (Reduction, Assumption-based reasoning, Weighing pros and cons, Suppression, and Hedging) heuristic, which describes the strategies that decision makers apply to different types of uncertainty in naturalistic settings.

		Integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is a worthy goal in scientific visualization. It allows researchers to make informed decisions based on imperfect data. It also allows users to visually compare and contrast different algorithms for performing the same task or different models for representing the same physical phenomenon. This work presents LISTEN – a data sonification system – that has been incorporated into two visualization systems: a system for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants and a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. LISTEN is written in C++ for the SGI platform. It works with the SGI internal audio chip or a MIDI device or both. LISTEN is an object-oriented system that is modular, flexible, adaptable, portable, interactive and extensible. We demonstrate that sonification is very effective as an additional tool in visualizing geometric and fluid flow uncertaint.

		Uncertainty or errors are introduced in fluid flow data as the data is acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. This work presents UFLOW – a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity especially near critical points in the flow field.

		Evaluating and comparing the quality of surface interpolants is an important problem in computer graphics, computer aided geometric design and scientic visualization. We introduce geometric uncertainty as a measure of interpolation error, level of condence or quality of an interpolant. Geometric uncertainty can be estimated as a scalar or a vectorvalued function that depends upon geometric characteristics of interpolants associated with the underlying data. These characteristics include position, normals, isophotes, principal curvatures and directions, mean and Gaussian curvatures. We present several new techniques for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants, that combine the strengths of traditional techniques such as pseudo-coloring, dierencing, overlay, and transparency with new glyph and texture-based techniques. The viewer can control an interactive query-driven toolbox to create a wide variety of graphics that allow probing of geometric information in useful and convenient ways. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by visualizing geometric uncertainty of surfaces obtained by different interpolation techniques { bilinear, C0 linear, C2 bicubic B-spline, multiquadrics, inverse multiquadrics and thin plate splines.

		This paper addresses the computation and visualization of the uncertainty associated with the positions of moving particles, using temporal projections based on uncertain knowledge of previous particle position and velocity. First, we present an algorithm for computing the probability distribution describing the position of a particle moving in 2D or 3D space, given the probability distributions that separately characterize the initial position, speed, and direction of the particle. The initial distributions are arbitrary, but the special case of Gaussian distributions is considered in greater detail.  We also discuss the algorithmic complexity of the algorithm, and ways to improve its performance. Three visualization techniques  (galaxy, transparency, and pseudo-color) are developed to represent  the resulting probability distribution associated with the particle at  a later time. An appropriate time-dependent sampling approach is adopted to make the visualizations more comprehensible to the human viewer. Experiments with different distributions indicate  that the resulting visualizations often take the form of recognizable real-world shapes, assisting the user in understanding the nature of a particle’s movement.

		We introduce multivalue data as a new data type in the context of scientific visualization. While this data type has existed in other fields, the visualization community has largely ignored it. Formally, a multivalue datum is a collection of values about a single variable. Multivalue data sets can be defined for multiple dimensions. A spatial multivalue data set consists of a multivalue datum at each physical location in the domain. The time dimension is equally valid. This leads to spatio-temporal multivalue data sets where there is time varying, multidimensional data with a multivalue datum at each location and time. The spatial multivalue data type captures multiple instances of the same variable at each location in space. Visualizing spatial multivalue data sets is a new challenge.

		Problems with standard Boolean maps produced through subjective interpretation of a phenomenon (i.e., forest or soils maps) are discussed and two alternatives based on spatial certainty are presented and discussed. One requires multiple interpretations of the phenomenon in order to construct a library of spatial uncertainties; such an Uncertainty Library can be used subsequently to estimate error across cartographic boundaries. The other requires interpreters/cartographers to identify only those map elements which are “100% certain.” A spatial interpolation algorithm is subsequently applied to this information to “fill in the gaps” with certainty information for each map type. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages relative to standard Boolean maps and also to each other. These are discussed in general terms and also through the presentation of specific examples. It is concluded that though uncertainty-based cartographic representations provide more flexibility than do conventional Boolean maps, the construction of the former is not without its problems either.

One model was a complex systems-based landscape model driven by hydrological dynamics whose calibration is an iterative semi-objective process. The other is a cropspecific landscape suitability model that is calibrated using expert knowledge. How fundamental model differences impact the type of uncertainty information that can be produced is discussed as are difficulties in producing such information. Finally, commonalities between the two approaches relative to uncertainty are discussed.

		This thesis focuses on uncertainties in remotely sensed image segmentation and their visualisation. The first part aims to develop and implement a visual exploration tool to interact with a fuzzy classification algorithm. The proposed tool uses dynamically linked views, consisting of an image display, a parallel coordinate plot, a 3D feature space plot, and a classified map with an uncertainty map. It allows interaction with the parameters of a fuzzy classification algorithm by visually adjusting fuzzy membership functions of classes. Its purpose is to improve insight into fuzzy classification of remotely sensed imagery and related uncertainty. The visual fuzzy classification technique is tested on a Landsat 7 ETM+ image of an area in Southern France characterised by land cover objects with indeterminate  boundaries. The visual classifier gives an overall classification accuracy of  88%, outperforming traditional fuzzy classifiers. Additionally, a focus group user test of the tool provides qualitative feedback and shows that insight into a fuzzy classification algorithm and uncertainty improves considerably.

		This study presents a new visualization tool for exploration of the results of a supervised fuzzy classification. 3D isosurfaces are introduced to visualize the shape and extent of class clusters in a 3D feature space plot. These isosurfaces are linked to an image display showing the spatial extent of classes. The dynamical link between feature space, image space, and user interaction with an uncertainty threshold allows for interactive exploration of the spatial and thematic aspects of uncertainty related to a fuzzy classification. The visualization tool is illustrated with a fuzzy classification of a Quickbird image of sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island.

		Direct volume rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a "sensitivity lens" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.

		In this paper, we define distributions as a new data type and address the challenges of visualizing spatial distribution data sets. Numerous visualization techniques exist today for dealing with scalar data. That is, there is a scalar value at each spatial location, which may also be changing over time. Likewise, techniques exist for dealing with vector, tensor and multivariate data sets. However, there is currently no systematic way of dealing with distribution data where there is a collection of values for the same variable at every location and time. Distribution data is increasingly becoming more common as computers and sensor technologies continue to improve. They have also been used in a number of fields ranging from agriculture, engineering design and manufacturing to weather forecasting. Rather than developing specialized visualization techniques for dealing with distribution data, the approach presented in this paper is to find a systematic way of extending existing visualization methods to handle this new data type. For example, we would like to be able to generate isosurfaces of 3D scalar distribution data sets, or generate streamlines of vector distribution data sets. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose the use of a set of mathematically and procedurally defined operators that allow us to work directly on distributions.

		When a GIS is used to drive map-based visualization, exploration of potential relationships takes precedence over presentation of facts. In these early stages of scientific analysis or policy formulation, providing a way for analysts to assess uncertainty in the data they are exploring is critical to the perspectives they form and the approaches they decide to pursue. As a basis from which to develop methods for visualizing uncertain information, this paper addresses the difference between data quality and uncertainty, the application of Berlin's graphic variables to the representation of uncertainty, conceptual models of spatial uncertainty as they relate to kinds of cartographic symbolization, and categories of user interfaces suited to presenting data and uncertainty about that data. Also touched on is the issue of how we might evaluate our attempts to depict uncertain information on maps.

		The power of human vision to synthesize information and recognize pattern is fundamental to the success of visualization as a scientific method. This same power can mislead investigators who use visualization to explore georeferenced data—if data reliability is not addressed directly in the visualization process. Here, we apply an integrated cognitive-semiotic approach to devise and test three methods for depicting reliability of georeferenced health data. The first method makes use of adjacent maps, one for data and one for reliability. This form of paired representation is compared to two methods in which data and reliability are spatially coincident (on a single map). A novel method for coincident visually separable depiction of data and data reliability on mortality maps (using a color fill to represent data and a texture overlay to represent reliability) is found to be effective in allowing map users to recognize unreliable data without interfering with their ability to notice clusters and characterize patterns in mortality rates. A coincident visually integral depiction (using color characteristics to represent both data and reliability) is found to inhibit perception of clusters that contain some enumeration units with unreliable data, and to make it difficult for users to consider data and reliability independently.

		Developing reliable methods for representing and managing information uncertainty remains a persistent and relevant challenge to GIScience. Information uncertainty is an intricate idea, and recent examinations of this concept have generated many perspectives on its representation and visualization, with perspectives emerging from a wide range of disciplines and application contexts. In this paper, we review and assess progress toward visual tools and methods to help analysts manage and understand information uncertainty. Specifically, we report on efforts to conceptualize uncertainty, decision making with uncertainty, frameworks for representing uncertainty, visual representation and user control of displays of information uncertainty, and evaluative efforts to assess the use and usability of visual displays of uncertainty. We conclude by identifying seven key research challenges in visualizing information uncertainty, particularly as it applies to decision making and analysis.

		This paper presents two linked empirical studies focused on uncertainty visualization. The experiments are framed from two conceptual perspectives. First, a typology of uncertainty is used to delineate kinds of uncertainty matched with space, time, and attribute components of data. Second, concepts from visual semiotics are applied to characterize the kind of visual signification that is appropriate for representing those different categories of uncertainty. This framework guided the two experiments reported here. The first addresses representation intuitiveness, considering both visual variables and iconicity of representation. The second addresses relative performance of the most intuitive abstract and iconic representations of uncertainty on a map reading task. Combined results suggest initial guidelines for representing uncertainty and discussion focuses on practical applicability of results.

		Weather forecasts are inherently uncertain, and meteorologists have information about weather forecast uncertainty that is not readily available to most forecast users. Yet effectively communicating forecast uncertainty to nonmeteorologists remains challenging. Improving forecast uncertainty communication requires research-based knowledge that can inform decisions on what uncertainty information to communicate, when, and how to do so. To help build such knowledge, this article explores the public’s perspectives on everyday weather forecast uncertainty and uncertainty information using results from a nationwide survey. By contributing to the fundamental understanding of laypeople’s views on forecast uncertainty, the findings can inform both uncertainty communication and related research.

		The article uses empirical data from a nationwide survey of the U.S. public to investigate beliefs commonly held among meteorologists and to explore new topics. The results show that when given a deterministic temperature forecast, most respondents expected the temperature to fall within a range around the predicted value. In other words, most people inferred uncertainty into the deterministic forecast. People’s preferences for deterministic versus nondeterministic forecasts were examined in two situations; in both, a significant majority of respondents liked weather forecasts that expressed uncertainty, and many preferred such forecasts to single-valued forecasts. The article also discusses people’s confidence in different types of forecasts, their interpretations of the probability of precipitation forecasts, and their preferences for how forecast uncertainty is conveyed. Further empirical research is needed to study the article’s findings in other contexts and to continue exploring perception, interpretation, communication, and use of weather forecast uncertainty.

		People's reasoning with uncertainty information is often flawed. Visual representations can help, but little is known about what is the best way to present such information. Two studies investigated the effect of visualizations on the understanding and use of wind speed forecast uncertainty. Participants varied in expertise from novices in weather forecasting (Experiment 1) to professional forecasters (Experiment 2). The authors investigated three visualizations: (a) a chart showing the amount of uncertainty, (b) a chart showing the worst-case scenario, and (c) a box plot of likely wind speeds. Participants were asked to determine the relative uncertainty in the forecast, predict wind speed, and decide whether to post a high-wind warning advisory. The results for novices and professional forecasters were similar. The uncertainty chart enhanced awareness of the degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast, box plots improved reading accuracy, and presenting a visualization of the worst-case scenario introduced bias in the deterministic wind speed forecast. An interactive display (e.g., a combination of an uncertainty chart with a box plot display) may be optimal to convey uncertainty information.

		Four new techniques for the visualization of uncertainty in volumetric data are introduced, including three glyph-based techniques (i.e., cylinder, cone, and multi-point glyphs) and one non-glyph-based approach. The non-glyph-based approach uses an aliasing mechanism. Four of the existing techniques for visualization of uncertainty in volumetric data are also described, including transparency, color mapping, and ball and arrow glyph techniques. These new and existing techniques are analyzed via a usability study that considers four aspects of the techniques’ effectiveness (identification of the data and of the uncertainty, visual overload, and brightness contrast) for one typical volume visualization scenario. The analysis suggests that while each technique has some utility for a scenario such as the tested one, the new multi-point glyph and the existing ball and arrow glyph techniques appear to be most advantageous.

		Perhaps the most common method of depicting data, in both scientific communication and popular media, is the bar graph. Bar graphs often depict measures of central tendency, but they do so asymmetrically: A mean, for example, is depicted not by a point, but by the edge of a bar that originates from a single axis. Here we show that this graphical asymmetry gives rise to a corresponding cognitive asymmetry. When viewers are shown a bar depicting a mean value and are then asked to judge the likelihood of a particular data point being part of its underlying distribution, viewers judge points that fall within the bar as being more likely than points equidistant from the mean, but outside the bar—as if the bar somehow “contained” the relevant data. This “within-the-bar bias” occurred (a) for graphs with and without error bars, (b) for bars that originated from both lower and upper axes, (c) for test points with equally extreme numeric labels, (d) both from memory (when the bar was no longer visible) and in online perception (while the bar was visible during the judgment), (e) both within and between subjects, and (f) in populations including college students, adults from the broader community, and online samples. We posit that this bias may arise due to principles of object perception, and we show how it has downstream implications for decision making.

Advances in computing hardware and algorithms have dramatically improved the ability to computationally simulate complex processes, enabling simulation and analysis of phenomena that in the past could be addressed only by resource-intensive experimentation, if at all.

		Visualization is a powerful way to facilitate data analysis, but it is crucial that visualization systems explicitly convey the presence, nature, and degree of uncertainty to users. Otherwise, there is a danger that data will be falsely interpreted, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions. A common method for denoting uncertainty is to use error bars or similar techniques designed to convey the degree of statistical uncertainty. While uncertainty can often be modeled statistically, a second form of uncertainty, bounded uncertainty, can also arise that has very different properties than statistical uncertainty. Error bars should not be used for bounded uncertainty because they do not convey the correct properties, so a different technique should be used instead. We describe a technique for conveying bounded uncertainty in visualizations and show how it can be applied systematically to common displays of abstract charts and graphs. Interestingly, it is not always possible to show the exact degree of uncertainty, and in some cases it can only be displayed approximately.

		As stated by Johnson [Joh04], the visualization of uncertainty remains one of the major challenges for the visualization community. To achieve this, we need to understand and develop methods that allow us not only to consider uncertainty as an extra variable within the visualization process, but to treat it as an integral part. In this paper, we take contouring, one of the most widely used visualization techniques for two dimensional data, and focus on extending the concept of contouring to uncertainty. We develop special techniques for the visualization of uncertain contours. We illustrate the work through application to a case study in oceanography.

		We introduce an approach to visualize stationary 2D vector fields with global uncertainty obtained by considering the transport of local uncertainty in the flow. For this, we extend the concept of vector field topology to uncertain vector fields by considering the vector field as a density distribution function. By generalizing the concepts of stream lines and critical points we obtain a number of density fields representing an uncertain topological segmentation. Their visualization as height surfaces gives insight into both the flow behavior and its uncertainty. We present a Monte Carlo approach where we integrate probabilistic particle paths, which lead to the segmentation of topological features. Moreover, we extend our algorithms to detect saddle points and present efficient implementations. Finally, we apply our technique to a number of real and synthetic test data sets.

		We present a technique to visualize global uncertainty in stationary 3D vector fields by a topological approach. We start from an existing approach for 2D uncertain vector field topology and extend this into 3D space. For this a number of conceptional and technical challenges in performance and visual representation arise. In order to solve them, we develop an acceleration for finding sink and source distributions. Having these distributions we use overlaps of their corresponding volumes to find separating structures and saddles. As part of the approach, we introduce uncertain saddle and boundary switch connectors and provide algorithms to extract them. For the visual representation, we use multiple direct volume renderings. We test our method on a number of synthetic and real data sets.

		Recent efforts in visualization have concentrated on high volume data sets from numerical simulations and medical imaging. There is another large class of data, characterized by their spatial sparsity with noisy and possibly missing data points, that also need to be visualized. Two places where these type of data sets can be found are in oceanographic and atmospheric science studies. In such cases, it is not uncommon to have on the order on one percent of sampled data available within a space volume. Techniques that attempt to deal with the problem of filling in the holes range in complexity from simple linear interpolation to more sophisticated multiquadric and optimal interpolation techniques. These techniques will generally produce results that do not fully agree with each other. To avoid misleading the users, it is important to highlight these differences and make sure the users are aware of the idiosyncrasies of the different methods. This paper compares some of these interpolation techniques on sparse data sets and also discusses how other parameters such as confidence levels and drop-off rates may be incorporated into the visual display.

		“Presenting data without error rate is misleading”. This is a quote from the O.J. Simpson defense team regarding the presentation of DNA evidence without valid error rate statistics. Taken more generally, this practice is a prevalent shortcoming in the scientific and information visualization communities where data are visualized without any indication of their associated uncertainties. While it is widely acknowledged that incorporating auxiliary information about data, i.e. data quality or uncertainty, is important, the relative amount of work in this area is small. On the other hand, developments by the geographic, cartographic, and GIS communities in this regard is much more concerted. Some of the early efforts were spearheaded by the participating members of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) initiatives (Beard et al. 1991; Goodchild et al. 1994), where different methods of displaying and animating data with uncertainty were proposed. An excellent summary of this body of work can be found in (MacEachren et al. 2005). Combining these works with those from the information and scientific visualization communities, a  typology for uncertainty visualization was presented which tries to map data, uncertainty, and tasks with the appropriate visual presentation (Thomson et al. 2005). Specifically, the typology for uncertainty visualization would give the user some guidance about the visual representations for the different types of uncertainty.

		Decision-making in the presence of uncertainty, i.e., selecting a sequence of responses in an uncertain environment according to a self-generated plan of action, is a complex activity that involves both cognitive and noncognitive processes. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the neural substrates of decision-making in the presence of uncertainty are examined. Normal control subjects show a significant activation of a frontoparietal and limbic neural system during a two-choice prediction task relative to a two-choice response task. The most prevalent response strategy during the two-choice prediction task was “win–stay/lose–shift,” where subjects will repeat the previous response if it successfully predicted the stimulus and switch to the alternative response otherwise. Increased frequency of responses that are consistent with this strategy is associated with activation in the superior temporal gyrus. In comparison, increased frequency of response inconsistent with win–stay/lose–shift is associated with parietal cortex activation. These results support the hypothesis that subjects use a frontoparietal neural system to establish a contingency based decision-making strategy even in the presence of random reinforcement.

		We present a framework for analyzing shape uncertainty and variability in point-sampled geometry. Our representation is mainly targeted towards discrete surface data stemming from 3D acquisition devices, where a finite number of possibly noisy samples provides only incomplete information about the underlying surface. We capture this uncertainty by introducing a statistical representation that quantifies for each point in space the likelihood that a surface fitting the data passes through that point. This likelihood map is constructed by aggregating local linear extrapolators computed from weighted least squares fits. The quality of fit of these extrapolators is combined into a corresponding confidence map that measures the quality of local tangent estimates. We present an analysis of the effect of noise on these maps, show how to efficiently compute them, and extend the basic definition to a scale-space formulation. Various applications of our framework are discussed, including an adaptive re-sampling method, an algorithm for reconstructing surfaces in the presence of noise, and a technique for robustly merging a set of scans into a single point-based representation.

Probability distribution functions are analysed in their cumulative form, and we can choose to visualize exceedance probabilities given a threshold value, or its inverse, the quantile values. Threshold value or quantile level can be modified dynamically. In addition, classified probabilities in terms of (1-alpha)x100% (e.g. 95%) confidence or prediction intervals can be visualized for a given threshold value. Different modelling scenarios can be compared by organizing maps in a regular lattice, where individual maps (scenarios) are shown in panels that share a common legend and behave identically to actions like zooming, panning, and identifying (querying) cells. Variability over time is incorporated by showing sets of maps as animated movies. We will demonstrate this tool using sea floor sediment quality predictions under different spatial aggregation scenarios (block sizes), covering the Dutch part of the North Sea.

		We present a novel approach for visualizing the positional and geometrical variability of isosurfaces in uncertain 3D scalar fields. Our approach extends recent work by Pöthkow and Hege [PH10] in that it accounts for correlations in the data to determine more reliable isosurface crossing probabilities. We introduce an incremental updatescheme that allows integrating the probability computation into front-to-back volume ray-casting efficiently. Our method accounts for homogeneous and anisotropic correlations, and it determines for each sampling interval along a ray the probability of crossing an isosurface for the first time. To visualize the positional and geometrical uncertainty even under viewing directions parallel to the surface normal, we propose a new color mapping scheme based on the approximate spatial deviation of possible surface points from the mean surface. The additional use of saturation enables to distinguish between areas of high and low statistical dependence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach for the visualization of uncertainty related to position and shape of convex and concave isosurface structures.

		Visualizing correlations, i.e., the tendency of uncertain data values at different spatial positions to change contrarily or according to each other, allows inferring on the possible variations of structures in the data. Visualizing global correlation structures, however, is extremely challenging, since it is not clear how the visualization of complicated long‐range dependencies can be integrated into standard visualizations of spatial data. Furthermore, storing correlation information imposes a memory requirement that is quadratic in the number of spatial sample positions. This paper presents a novel approach for visualizing both positive and inverse global correlation structures in uncertain 2D scalar fields, where the uncertainty is modeled via a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We introduce a new measure for the degree of dependency of a random variable on its local and global surroundings, and we propose a spatial clustering approach based on this measure to classify regions of a particular correlation strength. The clustering performs a correlation filtering, which results in a representation that is only linear in the number of spatial sample points. Via cluster coloring the correlation information can be embedded into visualizations of other statistical quantities, such as the mean and the standard deviation. We finally propose a hierarchical cluster subdivision scheme to further allow for the simultaneous visualization of local and global correlations.

		In uncertain scalar fields, where the values at every point can be assumed as realizations of a random variable, standard deviations indicate the strength of possible variations of these values from their mean values, independently of the values at any other point in the domain. To infer the possible variations at different points relative to each other, and thus to predict the possible structural occurrences, i.e., the structural variability, of particular features in the data, the correlation between the values at these points has to be considered. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the use of correlation as an indicator for the structural variability of isosurfaces in uncertain three-dimensional scalar fields. In a number of examples, we first demonstrate some general conclusions one can draw from the correlations in uncertain data regarding its structural variability. We will further explain, why an adequate correlation visualization is crucial for a comprehensive uncertainty analysis. Then, our focus is on the visualization of local and usually anisotropic correlation structures in the vicinity of uncertain isosurfaces. Therefore, we propose a model that can represent anisotropic correlation structures on isosurfaces and allows visual distinguishing of the local correlations between points on the surface and along the surface’s normal directions. A glyph-based approach is used to simultaneously visualize these dependencies. The practical relevance of our work is demonstrated in artificial and real-world examples using standard random distributions and ensemble simulations.

		Spatiotemporal applications, such as fleet management and air traffic control, involving continuously moving objects are increasingly at the focus of research efforts. The representation of the continuously changing positions of the objects is fundamentally important in these applications. This paper reports on on-going research in the representation of the positions of moving-point objects. More specifically, object positions are sampled using the Global Positioning System, and interpolation is applied to determine positions in-between the samples. Special attention is given in the representation to the quantification of the position uncertainty introduced by the sampling technique and the interpolation. In addition, the paper considers the use for query processing of the proposed representation in conjunction with indexing. It is demonstrated how queries involving uncertainty may be answered using the standard filter-and-refine approach known from spatial query processing.

		Information uncertainty which is inherent in many real world applications brings more complexity to the visualisation problem. Despite the increasing number of research papers found in the literature, much more work is needed. The aims of this chapter are threefold: (1) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the requirements of visualisation of information uncertainty and their dimensions of complexity; (2) to review and assess current progress; and (3) to discuss remaining research challenges. We focus on four areas: information uncertainty modelling, visualisation techniques, management of information uncertainty modelling, propagation and visualisation, and the uptake of uncertainty visualisation in application domains.
