The uncertainty visualisation browser is an interactive web-based visualisation tool that provides a review of published publications in uncertainty visualisation. This is a work in progress and we are continuously adding new research publications related to  uncertainty  visualisation  from  various  domains.

The design style of the browser is adapted from Tominski and Aignerâ€™s The TimeViz Browser (http://vcg.informatik.uni-rostock.de/~ct/timeviz/timeviz.html?).
